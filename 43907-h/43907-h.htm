<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<small>WAITING FOR WORD</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I do</span> wish you'd wear a sunbonnet, Betty," said
Mrs. Arnold, glancing up from her ironing board
as Betty Gordon came into the kitchen. "You're
getting old enough now to think a little about
your complexion."</p>

<p>Betty's brown eyes laughed over the rim of the
glass of water she had drawn at the sink.</p>

<p>"I can't stand a sunbonnet," she declared vehemently,
returning the glass to the nickel holder
under the shelf. "I know just how a horse feels
with blinders on. You know you wouldn't like it,
Mrs. Arnold, if I pulled up half your onion sets
in mistake for weeds because I couldn't see what
I was doing."</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold shook her head over the white
ruffle she was fluting with nervous, skillful fingers.</p>

<p>"There's no call for you to go grubbing in that
onion bed," she said. "I'd like you to have nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
hands and not be burnt black as an Indian when
your uncle comes. But then, nobody pays any attention
to what I say."</p>

<p>There was more truth in this statement than
Mrs. Arnold herself suspected. She was one of
these patient, anxious women who unconsciously
nag every one about them and whose stream of
complaint never rises above a constant murmur.
Her family were so used to Mrs. Arnold's monotonous
fault-finding that they rarely if ever
knew what she was complaining about. They did
not mean to be disrespectful, but they had fallen
into the habit of not listening.</p>

<p>"Uncle Dick won't mind if I'm as black as an
Indian," said Betty confidently, spreading out her
strong little brown right hand and eyeing it
critically. "With all the traveling he's done, I
guess he's seen people more tanned than I am.
You're sure there wasn't a letter this morning?"</p>

<p>"The young ones said there wasn't," returned
Mrs. Arnold, changing her cool iron for a hot
one, and testing it by holding it close to her flushed
face. "But I don't know that Ted and George
would know a letter if they saw it, their heads are
so full of fishing."</p>

<p>"I thought Uncle Dick would write again," observed
Betty wistfully. "But perhaps there wasn't
time. He said he might come any day."</p>

<p>"I don't know what he'll say," worried Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Arnold, her eyes surveying the slender figure
leaning against the sink. "Your not being in
mourning will certainly seem queer to him. I
hope you'll tell him Sally Pettit and I offered to
make you black frocks."</p>

<p>Betty smiled, her peculiarly vivid, rich smile.</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Arnold!" she said, affection warm
in her voice. "Of course I'll tell him. He will
understand, and not blame you. And now I'm
going to tackle those weeds."</p>

<p>The screen door banged behind her.</p>

<p>Betty Gordon was an orphan, her mother having
died in March (it was now June) and her
father two years before. The twelve-year-old
girl had to her knowledge but one single living
relative in the world, her father's brother, Richard
Gordon. Betty had never seen this uncle.
For years he had traveled about the country,
wherever his work called him, sometimes spending
months in large cities, sometimes living for
weeks in the desert. Mr. Gordon was a promoter
of various industrial enterprises and was
frequently sent for to investigate new mines, oil
wells and other large developments.</p>

<p>"I'd love to travel," thought Betty, pulling at
an especially stubborn weed. "I hope Uncle Dick
will like me and take me with him wherever he
goes. Wouldn't it be just like a fairy story if he
should come here and scoop me out of Pineville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and take me hundreds of miles away to beautiful
and exciting adventures!"</p>

<p>This enchanting prospect so thrilled the energetic
young gardener that she sat down comfortably
in the middle of the row to dream a little
more. While her father lived, Betty's home had
been in a small, bustling city where she had gone
to school in the winter. The family had always
gone to the seashore in the summer; but the only
exciting adventure she could recall had been a
tedious attack of the measles when she was six
years old. Mrs. Gordon, upon her husband's
sudden death, had taken her little daughter and
come back to Pineville, the only home she had
known as a lonely young orphan girl. She had
many kind friends in the sleepy country town, and
when she died these same friends had taken loving
charge of Betty.</p>

<p>The girl's grief for the loss of her mother baffled
the villagers who would have known how to
deal with sorrow that expressed itself in words or
flowed out in tears. Betty's long silences, her
desire to be left quite alone in her mother's room,
above all her determination not to wear mourning,
puzzled them. That she had sustained a
great shock no one could doubt. White and miserable,
she went about, the shadow of her former
gay-hearted self. For the first time in her life
she was experiencing a real bereavement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>When Betty's father had died, the girl's grieving
was principally for her mother's evident pain.
She had always been her mother's confidante and
chum, and the bond between them, naturally close,
had been strengthened by Mr. Gordon's frequent
absences on the road as a salesman. It was Betty
and her mother who locked up the house at night,
Betty and her mother who discussed household
finances and planned to surprise the husband and
father. The daughter felt his death keenly, but
she could never miss his actual presence as she did
that of the mother from whom she had never been
separated for one night from the time she was
born.</p>

<p>The neighbors took turns staying with the
stricken girl in the little brown house that had
been home for the two weeks following Mrs. Gordon's
death. Then, as Betty seemed to be recovering
her natural poise, a discussion of her
affairs was instigated. The house had been a
rented one and Betty owned practically nothing in
the world except the simple articles of furniture
that had been her mother's household effects.
These Mrs. Arnold stored for her in a vacant loft
over a store, and Mrs. Arnold, her mother's
closest friend, bore the lonely child off to stay
with them till Richard Gordon could be heard
from and some arrangement made for the future.</p>

<p>Communication with Mr. Gordon was necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
slow, since he moved about so frequently,
but when the news of his sister-in-law's death
reached him, he wrote immediately to Betty,
promising to come to Pineville as soon as he could
plan his business affairs to release him.</p>

<p>"Betty!" a shrill whisper, apparently in the
lilac bushes down by the fence, startled Betty
from her day dreams.</p>

<p>"Betty!" came the whisper again.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Ted?" called Betty, standing up
and looking expectantly toward the bushes.</p>

<p>"Sh! don't let ma hear you." Ted Arnold
parted the lilac bushes sufficiently to show his
round, perspiring face. "George and me's going
fishing, and we hid the can of worms under the
wheelbarrow. Hand 'em to us, will you, Betty?
If ma sees us, she'll want something done."</p>

<p>"Did you go to the post-office this morning?"
demanded Betty severely.</p>

<p>"Sure I did. There wasn't anything but a
postal from pa," came the answer from the
bushes. "He's coming home next week, and then
it'll be nothing but work in the garden all day
long. Hand us the can of worms, like a good
sport, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Where did you hide them?" asked Betty absently.</p>

<p>"Under the wheelbarrow, there at the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the arbor," directed Ted. "Thanks awfully,
Betty."</p>

<p>"Where's George?" she asked. "Isn't there
another mail at eleven, Ted?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Betty, how you do harp on one subject,"
complained Ted, poking about in his can of worms
with a stick, but keeping carefully out of sight of
the kitchen window and the maternal eye. "Hardly
anything ever comes in that eleven o'clock mail.
Anyway, didn't mother say your uncle would probably
come without bothering to write again?"</p>

<p>"I suppose he will," sighed Betty. "Only it
seems so long to wait. Where did you say George
was?"</p>

<p>Ted answered reluctantly.</p>

<p>"He's in swimming."</p>

<p>"Well I must say! You wait till your father
comes home," said Betty ominously.</p>

<p>The boys had been forbidden to go swimming
in the treacherous creek hole, and George was
where he had no business to be.</p>

<p>"You needn't tell everything you know," muttered
Ted uncomfortably, picking up his treasured
can and preparing to depart.</p>

<p>"Oh, I won't tell," promised Betty quickly.</p>

<p>She went back to her weeding, and Ted scuffled
off to fish.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" Betty pushed the hair from her
forehead with a grimy hand. "I do believe this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
is the warmest day we've had! I'll be glad when
I get down to the other end where the arbor
makes a little shade."</p>

<p>She had reached the end of the long row and
had stood up to rest her back when she saw some
one leaning over the white picket fence.</p>

<p>"Probably wants a drink of water," thought
Betty, crossing the strip of garden and grass to
ask him, after the friendly fashion of Pineville
folk. "I've never seen him before."</p>

<p>The stranger was leaning over the fence, staring
abstractedly at a border of sweet alyssum
which straggled down one side of the sunken
brick walk. He was tall and broad-shouldered,
and his straw hat pushed slightly back on his head
revealed a keen, tanned face and close-cropped
iron gray hair. He did not look up as Betty drew
near and suddenly she felt shy.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon," she faltered, "were
you looking for any particular house?"</p>

<p>The stranger lifted his hat, and a pair of sharp
blue eyes smiled pleasantly into Betty's brown
ones.</p>

<p>"I was looking, not for a particular house, but
for a particular person," admitted the man, gazing
at her intently. "I shouldn't wonder if I had
found her, too. Can you guess who I am?"</p>

<p>Betty's mind was so full of one subject that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
it would have been strange indeed if she had failed
to guess correctly.</p>

<p>"You're Uncle Dick!" she cried, throwing her
arms around his neck and running the risk of
spiking herself on the sharp pickets. "Oh, I
thought you'd never come!"</p>

<p>Uncle Dick, for it really was Mr. Gordon,
hurdled the low fence lightly and stood smiling
down on his niece.</p>

<p>"I don't believe in wasting time writing letters,"
he declared cheerfully, "especially as I seldom
know my plans three days ahead. You're
the image of your father, child. I should have
known you anywhere."</p>

<p>Betty put her hands behind her, suddenly conscious
that they could not be very clean.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I mussed your collar," she apologized
contritely. "Mrs. Arnold was hoping you'd
write so she could have me all scrubbed up for
you;" and here Betty's dimple would flicker out.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon put an arm about the little figure
in the grass-stained rose-colored smock.</p>

<p>"I'd rather find you a garden girl," he announced
contentedly. "Isn't there a place where
you and I can have a little talk before we go in
to see Mrs. Arnold and make our explanations?"</p>

<p>Betty drew him toward the arbor. She knew
they would be undisturbed there.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<small>UNCLE DICK'S PLAN</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> arbor was rather small and rickety, but
at least it was shady. Betty sat down beside her
uncle, who braced his feet against the opposite
seat to keep his place on the narrow ledge.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I take up a good deal of room,"
he said apologetically. "Well, my dear, had you
begun to think I was never coming?"</p>

<p>Betty glanced up at him bravely.</p>

<p>"It was pretty long&mdash;waiting," she admitted.
"But now you're here, Uncle Dick, everything is
all right. When can we go away?"</p>

<p>"Aren't you happy here, dear?" asked her
uncle, plainly troubled. "I thought from your
first letter that Mrs. Arnold was a pretty good
kind of friend, and I pictured you as contented as
a girl could possibly be after a bitter loss like
yours."</p>

<p>He smiled a bit ruefully.</p>

<p>"Maybe I'm not strong on pictures," he added.
"I thought of you as a little girl, Betty. Don't
know what'll you say, but there's a doll in my grip
for you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Betty laughed musically.</p>

<p>"I've always saved my old doll," she confided,
slipping a hand into Uncle Dick's broad fist where
it lay clinched on his knee. He was very companionable,
was this uncle, and she felt that she
already loved him dearly. "But, Uncle Dick,
I haven't really played with dolls since we moved
from the city. I like outdoor things."</p>

<p>"Well, now, so do I," agreed her uncle. "I
can't seem to breathe properly unless I'm outdoors.
But about this going away&mdash;do you want
to leave Pineville, Sister?"</p>

<p>Betty's troubled eyes rested on the little garden
hot in the bright sunshine.</p>

<p>"It isn't home any more, without mother," she
said slowly. "And&mdash;I don't belong, Uncle Dick.
Mrs. Arnold is a dear, and I love her and she
loves me. But they want to go to California,
though they won't talk it before me, 'cause they
think I'll feel in the way. Mr. Arnold has a
brother on a fruit farm, and he's wild to move out
there. As soon as you take me somewhere,
they're going to pack up."</p>

<p>"Well, then, we'll have to see that you do belong
somewhere," said Mr. Gordon firmly. "Anything
else, Sister?"</p>

<p>Betty drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"It's heavenly to have you to listen to me," she
declared. "I want to go! I've never been anywhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and I feel as though I could go and go
and never stop. Daddy was like that. Mother
used to say if he hadn't had us to look after he
would have been an explorer, but that he had to
manage to earn a living and do his traveling as a
salesman. Couldn't I learn to be a salesman, a
saleswoman, I mean? Lots of girls do travel."</p>

<p>"We'll think it over," answered her uncle diplomatically.</p>

<p>"And then there's another thing," went on
Betty, her pent-up thoughts finding relief in
speech. "Although Mrs. Arnold was mother's
dearest friend, I can't make her understand how
mother felt about wearing mourning."</p>

<p>Betty indicated her rose smock.</p>

<p>"Lots of Pineville folks think I don't care
about losing my mother," she asserted softly,
"because I haven't a single black dress. But
mother said mourning was selfish. She wouldn't
wear black when daddy died. Black makes other
people feel sorry. But I did love mother! And
do yet!"</p>

<p>Uncle Dick's keen blue eyes misted and the
brave little figure in the bright smock was blurred
for a moment.</p>

<p>"I suppose the whole town has been giving you
reams of advice," he said irrelevantly. "Well
Betty, I can't promise to take you with me&mdash;bless
me, what would an old bachelor like me do with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
a young lady like you? But I think I know of a
place where you can spend a summer and be
neither lonesome nor unhappy. And perhaps in
the fall we can make other arrangements."</p>

<p>Betty was disappointed that he did not promise
to take her with him at once. But she had been
trained not to tease, and she accepted the compromise
as pleasantly as it was offered.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Arnold will be disappointed if you don't
go round to the front door," she informed her
uncle, as he stretched his long legs preparatory
to rising from the low seat. "Company always
comes to the front door, Uncle Dick."</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon stepped out of the summer house
and turned toward the gate.</p>

<p>"We'll walk around and make a proper entry,"
he declared obligingly. "I meant to, and then as
I came up the street I remembered how we used
to cut across old Clinton's lot and climb the fence.
So I had to come the back way for old times'
sake."</p>

<p>Betty's eyes were round with wonder.</p>

<p>"Did you ever live in Pineville?" she asked in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to tell me you didn't know
that?" Uncle Dick was as surprised as his niece.
"Why, they shipped me into this town to read
law with old Judge Clay before they found there
was no law in me, and your father first met your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
mother one Sunday when he drove twenty miles
from the farm to see me."</p>

<p>Betty was still pondering over this when they
reached the Arnold front door and Mrs. Arnold,
flustered and delighted, answered Mr. Gordon's
knock.</p>

<p>"Sit right down on the front porch where it's
cool," she insisted cordially. "I've just put on
my dinner, and you'll have time for a good talk.
No, Betty, there isn't a thing you can do to help
me&mdash;you entertain your uncle."</p>

<p>But Betty, who knew that excitement always
affected Mrs. Arnold's bump of neatness, determined
to set the table, partly to help her hostess
and partly, it must be confessed, to make sure that
the knives and forks and napkins were in their
proper places.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know where those boys can
be," scolded the flushed but triumphant mother,
as she tested the flaky chicken dumplings and pronounced
the dinner "done to a turn." "We'll just
sit down without them, and it'll do 'em good," she
decided.</p>

<p>Betty ran through the hall to call her uncle.
Just as she reached the door two forlorn figures
toiled up the porch steps.</p>

<p>"Where's ma?" whispered Ted, for the moment
not seeing the stranger and appealing to
Betty, who stood in the doorway. "In the kitchen?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
We thought maybe we could sneak up the front
stairs."</p>

<p>Ted was plastered from head to foot with slimy
black mud, and George, his younger edition, was
draped only in a wet bath towel. Both boys clung
to their rough fishing rods, and Ted still carried
the dirty tin can that had once held bait.</p>

<p>"I should say," observed Mr. Gordon in his
deep voice, "that we had been swimming against
orders. Things usually happen in such cases."</p>

<p>"Oh, gee!" sighed Ted despairingly. "Who's
that? Company?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold had heard the talk, and she came
to the door now, pushing Betty aside gently.</p>

<p>"Well, I must say you're a pretty sight," she
told her children. "If your father were at home
you know what would happen to you pretty quick.
Betty's uncle here, too! Aren't you ashamed of
yourselves? I declare, I've a good mind to whip
you good. Where are your clothes, George?"</p>

<p>"They&mdash;they floated away," mumbled George.
"Ted borrowed this towel. It's Mrs. Smith's.
Say, ma, we're awful hungry."</p>

<p>"You march upstairs and get cleaned up," said
their mother sternly. "We're going to sit down
to dinner this minute. Chicken and dumplings.
When you come down looking like Christians I'll
see about giving you something to eat."</p>

<p>Midway in the delicious dinner Ted and George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
sidled into the room, very wet and shiny as to hair
and conspicuously immaculate as to shirt and
collar. Mrs. Arnold relented at the transformation
and proceeded to pile two plates high with
samples of her culinary skill.</p>

<p>"Betty," said Mr. Gordon suddenly, "is there
a garage here where we can hire a car?"</p>

<p>"There isn't a garage in Pineville," answered
Betty. "You see we're off the state road where
the automobile traffic goes. There are only two
or three cars in town, and they're for business.
But we can get a horse and buggy, Uncle Dick."</p>

<p>"Guess that's better, after all," said Mr. Gordon
contentedly. "I want to talk to you about
that plan I spoke of, and we'll stand a better
chance of having our talk if we travel behind a
horse. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;" his eyes twinkled&mdash;"if
there's a young man about who would care to
earn a quarter by running down to the livery stable
and seeing about a horse and buggy for the afternoon?"</p>

<p>Ted and George grinned above their respective
dishes of ice-cold rice pudding.</p>

<p>"I'll go," offered Ted.</p>

<p>"I'll go, too," promised George. "Can we
drive the rig back to the house?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon said they could, and the two boys
dispatched their dessert in double quick time.
While they went down to the town livery stable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Betty hurried to put on a cool, white frock, but,
to Mrs. Arnold's disappointment, she refused to
wear a hat.</p>

<p>"The buggy top will be up, so my complexion
will be safe," Betty declared merrily, giving Mrs.
Arnold a hearty squeeze as that lady followed her
downstairs to the porch where Mr. Gordon was
waiting.</p>

<p>"What's that? Go without a hat?" he repeated,
when Betty consulted him. "I should say
so! You're fifty times prettier with those smooth
braids than with any hat, I don't care how fine it
is. This must be our turnout approaching."</p>

<p>As he guessed, it was their horse and buggy
coming toward the house. Ted was driving, assisted
by George, and the patient horse was galloping
like mad as they urged it on.</p>

<p>"Never knew a boy of that age who could be
trusted to drive alone," muttered Mr. Gordon,
going down to the gate to meet them.</p>

<p>The boys beamed at him and Betty, sure that
they had pleased with their haste. They then
watched Betty step in, followed by her uncle, and
drive away with something like envy.</p>

<p>"Are you used to driving, Betty?" asked Mr.
Gordon, as he chirped lightly to the horse that
obediently quickened its lagging pace.</p>

<p>"Why, I've driven some," replied Betty hesitatingly.
"But I wouldn't know what to do if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
he should be frightened at anything. Do you like
to drive, Uncle?"</p>

<p>"I'm more used to horseback riding," was the
answer. "I hope you'll have a chance to learn
that this summer, Betty. I must have you measured
for a habit and have it sent up to you from
the city. There's no better sport for a man or a
woman, to my way of thinking, than can be found
in the saddle."</p>

<p>"Where am I going?" asked the girl timidly.
"Who'll teach me to ride?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there'll be some one," said her uncle
easily. "I never knew a ranch yet where there
were not good horsemen. The idea came to me
that you might like to spend the summer with
Mrs. Peabody, Betty."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Peabody?" repeated Betty, puzzled.
"Does she live on a ranch? I'd love to go out
West, Uncle Dick."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<small>DINING OUT</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment Mr. Gordon stared at his niece,
a puzzled look in his eyes. Then his face cleared.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. You've made a natural mistake,"
he said. "Mrs. Peabody doesn't live out West,
Betty, but up-state&mdash;about one hundred and fifty
miles north of Pineville. I've picked up that word
ranch in California. Everything outside the town
limits, from a quarter of an acre to a thousand,
is called a ranch. I should have said farm."</p>

<p>Betty settled back in the buggy, momentarily
disappointed. A farm sounded so tame and&mdash;and
ordinary.</p>

<p>"The plan came to me while I was sitting out
on the porch waiting for dinner," pursued her
uncle, unconscious that he had dashed her hopes.
"Your father and I had such a happy childhood
on a farm that I'm sure he would want you to
know something about such a life first-hand. But
of course I intend to talk it over with you before
writing to Agatha."</p>

<p>"Agatha?" repeated Betty.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Peabody," explained Mr. Gordon. "She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and I went to school together. Last year I happened
to run across her brother out in the mines.
He told me that Agatha had married, rather well,
I understood, and was living on a fine, large farm.
What did he say they called their place? 'Bramble
Farm'&mdash;yes, that's it."</p>

<p>"Bramble Farm," echoed Betty. "It sounds
like wild roses, doesn't it, Uncle Dick? But suppose
Mrs. Peabody doesn't want me to come to
live with her?"</p>

<p>"Bless your heart, child, this is no permanent
arrangement!" exclaimed her uncle vigorously.
"You're my girl, and mighty proud I am to have
such a bonny creature claiming kin with me. I've
knocked about a good bit, and sometimes the
going has been right lonesome."</p>

<p>He seemed to have forgotten the subject of
Bramble Farm for the moment, and something in
his voice made Betty put out a timid hand and
stroke his coat sleeve silently.</p>

<p>"All right, dear," he declared suddenly, throwing
off the serious mood with the quick shift that
Betty was to learn was characteristic of him. "If
your old bachelor uncle had the slightest idea
where he would be two weeks from now, he'd take
you with him and not let you out of his sight.
But I don't know; though I strongly suspect, and
it's no place to take a young lady to. However,
if we can fix it up with Agatha for you to spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the summer with her, perhaps matters will shape
up better in the fall. I'll tell her to get you fattened
up a bit; she ought to have plenty of fresh
eggs and milk."</p>

<p>Betty made a wry face.</p>

<p>"I don't want to be fat, Uncle Dick," she protested.
"I remember a fat girl in school, and
she had an awful time. Is Mrs. Peabody old?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon laughed.</p>

<p>"That's a delicate question," he admitted.
"She's some three or four years younger than I,
I believe, and I'm forty-two. Figure it out to
suit yourself."</p>

<p>The bay horse had had its own sweet way so
far, and now stopped short, the road barred by
a wide gate. It turned its head and looked reproachfully
at the occupants of the buggy.</p>

<p>"Bless me, I never noticed where we were
going," said Mr. Gordon, surprised. "What's
this we're in, Betty, a private lane? Where does
it lead?"</p>

<p>"Let me open the gate," cried Betty, one foot
on the step. "We're in Mr. Bradway's meadow.
Uncle Dick. We can keep right on and come out
on the turnpike. He doesn't care as long as the
gates are kept closed."</p>

<p>"I'll open the gate," said Mr. Gordon decidedly.
"Take the reins and drive on through."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Betty obeyed, and Mr. Gordon swung the
heavy gate into place again and fastened it.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Peabody pretty?" asked Betty, as he
took his place beside her and gathered up the
lines. "Has she any children?"</p>

<p>The blue eyes surveyed her quizzically.</p>

<p>"A real girl, aren't you?" teased her uncle.
"Why, child, I couldn't tell you to save me,
whether Agatha is pretty or not. I haven't seen
her for years. But she has no children. Her
brother, Lem, told me that. She was a pretty
girl." Mr. Gordon added reflectively: "I recollect
she had long yellow braids and very blue eyes.
Yes, she's probably a pretty woman."</p>

<p>To reach the turnpike they had to pass through
another barred gate, and then when they did turn
into the main road, Mr. Gordon, glancing at his
watch, uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>"Four o'clock," he announced. "Why, it must
have been later than I thought when we started.
The horse has taken its own sweet time. Look,
Betty, is there a place around here where we can
get some ice-cream?"</p>

<p>Betty's eyes danced. Like most twelve-year-old
girls, she regarded ice-cream as a treat.</p>

<p>"There's a place in Pineville; but let's not go
there&mdash;the whole town goes to the drug-store in
the afternoons," she answered. "Couldn't we go
as far as Harburton and stop at the ice-cream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
parlor? The horse isn't very tired, is it, Uncle
Dick?"</p>

<p>"Considering the pace he has been going, I
doubt it," responded her uncle. "What's the matter
with you and me having a regular lark, Betty?
Let's not go back for supper&mdash;we'll have it at
the hotel. They can put up the horse, and we'll
drive back when it's cooler."</p>

<p>Betty was thrilled at the idea of eating supper
at the Harburton Hotel; certainly that would be
what she called "exciting." But since her mother's
death she had learned to think not only for herself
but for others.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Arnold would be so worried," she objected,
trying to keep the longing out of her voice.
"She'd think we'd been struck at the grade crossing.
And, Uncle Dick, I don't believe this dress
is good enough."</p>

<p>But Mr. Gordon was not accustomed to being
balked by objections. He swept Betty's aside
with a half-dozen words. They would telephone
to Mrs. Arnold. Well, then, if she had no telephone,
they would telephone a near neighbor and
get her to carry the message. As for the dress&mdash;here
he glanced contentedly at Betty&mdash;he didn't
see but that she looked fine enough to attend the
King's wedding. She could wash and freshen up
a little when they reached the hotel.</p>

<p>Betty's face glowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're just like Daddy," she said happily.
"Mother used to say she never had to worry
about anything when he was at home. Mrs. Arnold
doesn't either, when her husband's home.
Do all husbands do the deciding, Uncle Dick?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon submitted, amusedly, that as he
was not a husband, he could not give accurate information
on that point. But Betty's active mind
was turning over something.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Arnold says Mr. Arnold makes the boys
stand round," she confided. "I notice they mind
him ten times as quick as they do their mother.
But they love him more. Do you make people
stand round, Uncle Dick?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon smiled down into the serious little
face tilted to meet his glance.</p>

<p>"I haven't much patience with disobedience,
I'm afraid," he replied. "I suppose some of the
men I've bossed would consider me a Tartar.
Why, Betty? Are you thinking of going on strike
against my authority? I don't advise you to
try it."</p>

<p>Betty blushed.</p>

<p>"It isn't that," she said hastily. "But&mdash;but&mdash;well,
I have a temper, Uncle Dick. I get so
raging mad! If I don't tell you, some one else
will, or else you'll see me 'acting up,' as Mrs.
Arnold says, before you go. So I thought I'd
better tell you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Gordon's lips twitched.</p>

<p>"A temper, out of control, is a mighty useless
possession," he said solemnly. "But as long as
you know you've got a spark of fire in you, Betty,
you can watch out for it. Afraid of going on
the rampage while you're at Bramble Farm? Is
that what's worrying you?"</p>

<p>"Some," confessed his niece, with scarlet cheeks.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what to do," counseled Mr. Gordon,
and his even, rather slow voice soothed Betty
inexpressibly. "When you get a 'mad fit,' you
fly out to the wood pile and chop kindling as hard
as you can. You can't talk and chop wood, and
the tongue does most of the mischief when our
tempers get the best of us. You'll remember that
little trick, won't you?"</p>

<p>Betty promised she would, and, as they were
now driving into the thriving county seat of Harburton,
she began to point out the few places of
interest.</p>

<p>The hotel was opposite the court house, and
as they stopped before the curb and Betty saw
the porch well filled with men, with here and there
a woman in a pretty summer dress, she felt extremely
shy. A boy ran up to take their horse
and lead it around to the stables for a rub-down
and a comfortable supper. Mr. Gordon tucked
his niece's hand under his arm and marched unconcernedly
up the hotel steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose he's used to hotels," thought Betty,
sinking into one of the stuffed red velvet chairs
at her uncle's bidding and looking interestedly
about her as he went in search of the proprietor.
"I wonder if it's fun to live in a hotel all the time
instead of a house."</p>

<p>Her uncle came back in a few moments with
a pleasant-faced, matronly woman, whom he introduced
as the sister of the proprietor. She
was to take Betty upstairs and let her make herself
neat for supper, which would, so the woman
said, be ready in twenty minutes.</p>

<p>"I'll wait for you right here," promised Mr.
Gordon, divining in Betty's anxious glance a fear
that she would have to search for him on the
crowded piazza.</p>

<p>"You drove in, didn't you?" asked Mrs.
Holmes, leading the way upstairs and ushering
Betty into a pretty, chintz-hung room. "You'll
find fresh water in the pitcher, dear. Didn't
your father say you were from Pineville?"</p>

<p>Betty, pouring the clear, cool water into the
basin, explained that Mr. Gordon was her uncle
and said that they had driven over from Pineville
that afternoon.</p>

<p>"Well, you want to be careful driving back,"
cautioned Mrs. Holmes. "The flag man goes
off duty at six o'clock, and that crossing lies right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in a bad cut. There was a nasty accident there
last week."</p>

<p>Betty had read of it in the <i>Pineville Post</i>, and
thanked Mrs. Holmes for her warning. When
that kind woman had ascertained that Betty
needed nothing more, she excused herself and
went down to superintend the two waitresses.</p>

<p>Betty managed to smooth her hair nicely with
the aid of a convenient sidecomb, and after bathing
her face and hands felt quite refreshed and
neat again. She found her uncle reading a magazine.</p>

<p>"Well, you look first rate," he greeted her. "I
picked this up off the table without glancing at it;
it's a fashion magazine. It reminds me, Betty,
you'll need some new clothes this summer, eh?
You'll have to take Mrs. Arnold when you go
shopping. I wouldn't know a bonnet from a pair
of gloves."</p>

<p>Betty laughed and slipped her hand into his,
and they went toward the dining room. What a
dear Uncle Dick was! She had not had many
new clothes since her father's death.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>AT THE CROSSING</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> country hotel supper was no better than
the average of its kind, but to Betty, to whom
any sort of change was "fun," it was delicious.
She and Uncle Dick became better acquainted
over the simple meal in the pleasant dining room
than they could ever have hoped to have been
with Mrs. Arnold and the two boys present, and
it was not until her dessert was placed before her
that Betty remembered her friend.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Arnold will think we're lost!" she exclaimed
guiltily. "I meant to telephone! And
oh, Uncle Dick, she does hate to keep supper
waiting."</p>

<p>Uncle Dick smiled.</p>

<p>"I telephoned the neighbor you told me
about," he said reassuringly. "She said she would
send one of her children right over with the message.
That was while you were upstairs. So I
imagine Mrs. Arnold has George and Ted hard
at work drying the dishes by this time."</p>

<p>"They don't dry the dishes, 'cause they're
boys," explained Betty dimpling. "In Pineville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the men and boys never think of helping with the
housework. Mother said once that was one
reason she fell in love with daddy&mdash;because he
came out and helped her to do a pile of dishes
one awfully hot Sunday afternoon."</p>

<p>After supper Betty and her uncle walked about
Harburton a bit, and Betty glanced into the shop
windows. She knew that probably her new
dresses, at least the material for them, would be
bought here, and she was counting more on the
new frocks than even Uncle Dick knew.</p>

<p>When they went back to the hotel it was still
light, but the horse was ordered brought around,
for they did not want to hurry on the drive home.</p>

<p>"I guess I missed not belonging to any body,"
she said shyly, after a long silence.</p>

<p>Uncle Dick glanced down at her understandingly.</p>

<p>"I've had that feeling, too," he confessed. "We
all need a sense of kinship, I think, Betty. Or a
home. I haven't had either for years. Now you
and I will make it up to each other, my girl."</p>

<p>The darkness closed in on them, and Uncle
Dick got out and lit the two lamps on the dashboard
and the little red danger light behind.
Once or twice a big automobile came glaring out
of the road ahead and swept past them with a
roar and a rush, but the easy going horse refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to change its steady trot. But presently, without
warning, it stopped.</p>

<p>Uncle Dick slapped the reins smartly, with no
result.</p>

<p>"He balks," said Betty apologetically. "I know
this horse. The livery stable man says he never
balks on the way home, but I suppose he was so
good all the afternoon he just has to act up
now."</p>

<p>"Balks!" exploded Uncle Dick. "Why, no
stable should send out a horse with that habit.
Is there any special treatment he favors, Betty?"
he added ironically.</p>

<p>Betty considered.</p>

<p>"Whipping him only makes him worse, they
say," she answered. "He puts his ears back and
kicks. Once he kicked a buggy to pieces. I guess
we'll have to get out and coax him, Uncle Dick."</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon snorted, but he climbed down and
went to the horse's head.</p>

<p>"You stay where you are, Betty," he commanded.
"I'm not going to have you dancing all
over this dark road and likely to be run down by
a car any minute simply to cater to the whim of a
fool horse. You hold the reins and if he once
starts don't stop him; I'll catch the step as it
goes by."</p>

<p>Betty held the reins tensely and waited. There
was no moon, and clouds hid whatever light they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
might have gained from the stars. It was distinctly
eery to be out on the dark road, miles
from any house, with no noise save the incessant
low hum of the summer insects. Betty shivered
slightly.</p>

<p>She could hear her uncle talking in a low tone
to the dejected, drooping, stubborn bay horse, and
she could see the dim outline of his figure. The
rays of the buggy lamps showed her a tiny patch
of the wheels and road, but that was every bit
she could see.</p>

<p>Up over the slight rise of ground before
them shone a glare, followed in a second by the
headlights of a large touring car. Abreast of
the buggy it stopped.</p>

<p>"Tire trouble?" asked some one with a hint
of laughter in the deep strong voice.</p>

<p>"No, head trouble," retorted Mr. Gordon,
stepping over to the driver of the car. "Balky
horse."</p>

<p>"You don't say!" The motorist seemed surprised
and interested. "I'd give you a tow if you
were going my way. But, do you know, my son
who runs a farm for me has a way of fixing a
horse like that. He says it's all mental. Beating
'em is a waste of time. Jim unharnesses a horse
that balks with him, leads it on a way and then
rolls the wagon up and gears up again. Horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
thinks he's starting all over&mdash;new trip, you see.
What's the word I want?"</p>

<p>"Psychological?" said the sweet, clear voice of
Betty promptly.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be jiggered!" the motorist swept off
his cap. "Thank you, whoever you are. That's
what I wanted to say. Yes, nowadays they believe
in reasoning with a horse. I'll help you unhitch
if you say so."</p>

<p>"Let me," pleaded Betty. "Please, Uncle Dick.
I know quite a lot about unharnessing. Can't I
get out and do one side?"</p>

<p>The motorist was already out of his car, and
at her uncle's brief "all right," Betty slipped down
and ran to the traces. The stranger observed her
curiously.</p>

<p>"Thought you were older," he said genially.
"Where did a little tyke like you get hold of such
a long word?"</p>

<p>"I read it," replied Betty proudly. "They use
it in the Ladies' Aid when they want to raise more
money than usual and they hate to ask for it.
Mrs. Banker says there's a psychological moment
to ask for contributions, and I have to copy the
secretary's notes for her."</p>

<p>"I see," said the stranger. "There! Now,
Mr. Heady here is free, and we'll lead him up
the road a way."</p>

<p>Uncle Dick led the horse, who went willingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
enough, and Betty and the kind friend-in-need, as
she called him to herself, each took a shaft of the
light buggy and pulled it after them. To their
surprise, when the horse was again harnessed to
the wagon it started at the word "gid-ap," and
gave every evidence of a determination to do as
all good horses do&mdash;whatever they are ordered.</p>

<p>"Guess he's all right," said the motorist, holding
out his hand to Mr. Gordon. "Now, don't
thank me&mdash;only ordinary road courtesy, I assure
you. Hope your troubles are over for the night."</p>

<p>The two men exchanged cards, and, lifting his
hat to Betty, though he couldn't see her in the
buggy, the stranger went back to his car.</p>

<p>"Wasn't he nice?" chattered Betty, as the horse
trotted briskly. Uncle Dick grimly resolved to
make it pay for the lost time. "We might have
been stuck all night."</p>

<p>"Every indication of it," admitted Mr. Gordon.
"However, I'm glad to say that I've always found
travelers willing to go to any trouble to help.
Don't ever leave a person in trouble on the road
if you can do one thing to aid him, Betty. I want
you to remember that."</p>

<p>Betty promised, a bit sleepily, for the motion
and the soft, night air were making her drowsy.
She sat up, however, when they came in sight of
the winking red and green lights that showed the
railroad crossing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"No gateman, is there?" inquired her uncle.
"Well, I'll go ahead and look, and you be ready
to drive across when I whistle."</p>

<p>He climbed down and ran forward, and Betty
sat quietly, the reins held ready in her hand. In
a few moments she heard her signal, a clear, sharp
whistle. She spoke to the horse, who moved on
at an irritatingly slow pace.</p>

<p>"For goodness sake!" said Betty aloud, "can't
you hurry?"</p>

<p>She peered ahead, trying to make out her
uncle's figure, but the heavy pine trees that grew
on either side of the road threw shadows too deep
for anything to be plainly outlined. Betty, nervously
on the lookout, scarcely knew when they
reached the double track, but she realized her
position with a sickening heart thump when the
horse stopped suddenly. The bay had chosen the
grade crossing as a suitable place to enjoy a second
fit of balkiness.</p>

<p>"Uncle Dick!" cried Betty in terror. "Uncle
Dick, he's stopped again! Come and help me
unhitch!"</p>

<p>No one answered.</p>

<p>Betty had nerves as strong and as much presence
of mind as any girl of her age, but a woman
grown might consider that she had cause for hysterics
if she found herself late at night marooned
in the middle of a railroad track with a balky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
horse and no one near to give her even a word
of advice. For a moment Betty rather lost her
head and screamed for her uncle. This passed
quickly though, and she became calmer. The
whip she knew was useless. So was coaxing.
There was nothing to do with any certainty of
success but to unharness the horse and lead her
over. But where was Uncle Dick?</p>

<p>Betty jumped down from the buggy and ran
ahead into the darkness, calling.</p>

<p>"Uncle Dick!" shouted Betty. "Uncle Dick,
where are you?"</p>

<p>The cheery little hum of the insects filled the
silence as soon as her voice died away. There
was no other sound. Common sense coming to
her aid, Betty reasoned that her uncle would not
have gone far from the crossing, and she soon
began to retrace her steps, calling at intervals.
As she came back to the twinkling red and green
lights, she heard a noise that brought her heart
into her throat. Some one had groaned!</p>

<p>"He's hurt!" she thought instantly.</p>

<p>The groan was repeated, and, listening carefully,
Betty detected that it came from the other
side of the road. A few rods away from the
flagman's house was a pit that had recently been
excavated for some purpose and then abandoned.
Betty peered down into this.</p>

<p>"Uncle Dick?" she said softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Another deep groan answered her.</p>

<p>Betty ran back to the buggy and managed to
twist one of the lamps from the dashboard. She
was back in a second, and carefully climbed down
into the pit. Sure enough, huddled in a deplorable
heap, one foot twisted under him, lay
Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>Betty had had little experience with accidents,
but she instinctively took his head in her lap and
loosened his collar. He was unconscious, but
when she moved him he groaned again heart-breakingly.</p>

<p>"How shall I ever get him up to the road?"
wondered Betty, wishing she knew something of
first-aid treatment. "If I could drag him up and
then go and get the horse and buggy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her pulse gave an astounding leap and her
brown eyes dilated. Putting her uncle's head
back gently on the gravel, she scrambled to her
feet, feeling only that whatever she did she must
not waste time in screaming. She had heard the
whistle of a train!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<small>MRS. PEABODY WRITES</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bad, little stubborn horse standing on the
track at the mercy of the coming comet! That
was Betty's thought as she sped down the road.
In the hope that a sense of the danger might have
reached the animal's instinct, she gave the bridle a
desperate tug when she reached the horse, but it
was of no use. Feverishly Betty set to work to
unharness the little bay horse.</p>

<p>She was unaccustomed to many of the buckles,
and the harness was stiff and unyielding. Working
at it in a hurry was very different from the
few times she had done it for fun, or with some
one to manage all the hard places. She had finished
one side when the whistle sounded again.
To the girl's overwrought nerves it seemed to be
just around the curve. She had no thought of
abandoning the animal, however, and she set her
teeth and began on the second set of snaps and
buckles. These, too, gave way, and with a strong
push Betty sent the buggy flying backward free
of the tracks, and, seizing the bridle, she led the
cause of all the trouble forward and into safety.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
For the third time the whistle blew warningly,
and this time the noise of the train could be plainly
heard. But it was nearly a minute before the
glare of the headlight showed around the curve.</p>

<p>"Look what didn't hit you, no thanks to you,"
Betty scolded the horse, as a relief to herself. "I
'most wish I'd left you there; only then we never
would get Uncle Dick home."</p>

<p>Poor Betty had now the hardest part of her
task before her. She went back and dragged the
buggy over the tracks, up to the horse and started
the tedious business of harnessing again. She was
not sure where all the straps went, but she hoped
enough of them would hold together till they
could get home. When she had everything as
nearly in place as she could get them she climbed
down into the pit.</p>

<p>To her surprise, her uncle's eyes were open.
He lay gazing at the buggy lamp she had left.</p>

<p>"Uncle Dick," she whispered, "are you hurt?
Can you walk? Because you're so big, I can't
pull you out very well."</p>

<p>"Why, I can't be hurt," said her uncle slowly
in his natural voice. "What's happened? Where
are we? Goodness, child, you look like a ghost
with a dirty face."</p>

<p>Betty was not concerned with her looks at that
moment, and she was so delighted to find her
uncle conscious that she did not feel offended at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
his uncomplimentary remark. In a few words she
sketched for him what had happened.</p>

<p>"My dear child!" he ejaculated when she had
told him, "have you been through all that? Why,
you're the pluckiest little woman I ever heard
of! No wonder you look thoroughly done up.
All I remember is whistling for you to come
ahead and then taking a step that landed me
nowhere. In other words, I must have stepped
into this pit. I'm not hurt&mdash;just a bit dazed."</p>

<p>To prove it, he got to his feet a trifle shakily.
Declining Betty's assistance, he managed to
scramble out of the pit, up on to the road. His
head cleared rapidly, and in a few more moments
he declared he felt like himself.</p>

<p>"In with you," he ordered Betty, after a preliminary
examination of the harness which, he
announced, was "as right as a trivet." "You've
done your share for to-night. Go to sleep, if you
like, and I'll wake you up in time to hear Mrs.
Arnold send Ted out to take the horse around to
the livery stable. It wouldn't do for me to do it&mdash;I
might murder the owner!"</p>

<p>Betty leaned her head against her uncle's
broad shoulder, for a minute she thought, and
when she woke found herself being helped gently
from the buggy.</p>

<p>"You're all right, Betty," soothed Mrs. Arnold's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
voice in the darkness. "I've worried myself
sick! Do you know it's one o'clock?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon took the wagon around to the
stable, and Betty, with Mrs. Arnold's help, got
ready for bed.</p>

<p>Betty was fast asleep almost before the undressing
was completed, and she slept until late
the next morning. When she came down to the
luxury of a special breakfast, she found only Mrs.
Arnold in the house.</p>

<p>"Your uncle's gone out to post a letter," that
voluble lady informed her. "Both boys have
gone fishing again. I'm only waiting for their
father to come home and straighten 'em out.
Will you have cocoa, dearie?"</p>

<p>Before she had quite finished her breakfast,
Mr. Gordon came back from the post-office, and
then, as Mrs. Arnold wanted to go over to a
neighbor's to borrow a pattern, he sat down opposite
Betty.</p>

<p>"You look rested," he commented. "I don't
like to think what might have happened last night.
However, we'll be optimistic and look ahead.
I've written to Mrs. Peabody, dear, and to-morrow
I think you and Mrs. Arnold had better go
shopping. I'll write you a check this morning.
Agatha will want you to come, I know. And to
tell you the truth, Betty, I've had a letter that
makes me anxious to be off. I want to stay to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
you safely started for Bramble Farm, and then I
must peg away at this new work. Finished?
Then let's go into the sitting room and I'll explain
about the check."</p>

<p>The next morning Betty and Mrs. Arnold
started for Harburton with what seemed to Betty
a small fortune folded in her purse. Mrs. Arnold
had shown her how to cash the check at the Pineville
Bank, and she was to advise as to material
and value of the clothing Betty might select; but
the outfit was to represent Betty's choice and was
to please her primarily&mdash;Uncle Dick had made
this very clear.</p>

<p>Betty had learned a good deal about shopping
in the last months of her mother's illness, and she
did not find it difficult to choose suitable and
pretty ginghams for her frocks, a middy blouse or
two, some new smocks, and a smart blue sweater.
She very sensibly decided that as she was to spend
the summer on a farm she did not need elaborate
clothes, and she knew, from listening to Mrs.
Arnold, that those easiest to iron would probably
please Mrs. Peabody most whether she did her
own laundry work or had a washerwoman.</p>

<p>When the purchases came home Uncle Dick
delighted Betty with his warm approval. For a
couple of days the sewing machine whirred from
morning to night as the village dressmaker sewed
and fitted the new frocks and made the old presentable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Then the letter from Mrs. Peabody arrived.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I will be very glad to have your niece spend
the summer with me," she wrote, in a fine, slanting
hand. "The question of board, as you arrange
it, is satisfactory. I would not take anything for
her, you know, Dick, and for old times' sake
would welcome her without compensation, but
living is so dreadfully high these days. Joseph
has not had good luck lately, and there are so
many things against the farmer.... Let me
know when to expect Betty and some one will
meet her."</p></blockquote>

<p>The letter rambled on for several pages, complaining
rather querulously of hard times and the
difficulties under which the writer and her husband
managed to "get along."</p>

<p>"Doesn't sound like Agatha, somehow," worried
Uncle Dick, a slight frown between his eyes.
"She was always a good-natured, happy kind of
girl. But most likely she can't write a sunny
letter. I know we used to have an aunt whose
letters were always referred to as 'calamity howlers.'
Yet to meet her you'd think she hadn't a
care in the world. Yes, probably Agatha puts
her blues into her letters and so doesn't have any
left to spill around where she lives."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Several times that day Betty saw him pull the
letter from his pocket and re-read it, always with
the puzzled lines between his brows. Once he
called to her as she was going upstairs.</p>

<p>"Betty," he said rather awkwardly, "I don't
know exactly how to put it, but you're going to
board with Mrs. Peabody, you know. You'll be
independent&mdash;not 'beholden,' as the country folk
say, to her. I want you to like her and to help
her, but, oh, well, I guess I don't know what I
am trying to say. Only remember, child, if you
don't like Bramble Farm for any good reason, I'll
see that you don't have to remain there."</p>

<p>A brand-new little trunk for Betty made its appearance
in the front hall of the Arnold house,
and two subdued boys&mdash;for Mr. Arnold had returned
home&mdash;helped her carry down her new
treasures and, after the clothes were neatly
packed, strap and lock the trunk. There was a
tiny "over-night" bag, too, fitted with toilet articles
and just large enough to hold a nightdress
and a dressing gown and slippers. Betty felt
very young-ladyish indeed with these traveling accessories.</p>

<p>"I'll order a riding habit for you in the first
large city I get to," promised her uncle. "I want
you to learn to ride&mdash;I wrote Agatha that. She
doesn't say anything about saddle horses, but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
must have something you can ride. And you'll
write to me, my dear, faithfully?"</p>

<p>"Of course," promised Betty, clinging to him,
for she had learned to love him dearly even in
the short time they had been together. "I'll
write to you, Uncle Dick, and I'll do everything
you ask me to do. Then, this winter, do let's
keep house."</p>

<p>"We will," said Uncle Dick, fervently, "if we
have to keep house on the back of a camel in the
desert!" At this Betty giggled delightedly.</p>

<p>Betty's train left early in the morning, and her
uncle went to the station with her. Mrs. Arnold
cried a great deal when she said good-bye, but
Betty cheered her up by picturing the long, chatty
letters they would write to each other and by assuring
her friend that she might yet visit her in
California.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon placed his niece in the care of the
conductor and the porter, and the last person
Betty saw was this gray-haired uncle running beside
the train, waving his hat and smiling at her
till her car passed beyond the platform.</p>

<p>"Now," said Betty methodically, "if I think
back, I shall cry; so I'll think ahead."</p>

<p>Which she proceeded to do. She pictured Mrs.
Peabody as a gray-haired, capable, kindly woman,
older than Mrs. Arnold, and perhaps more serene.
She might like to be called "Aunt Agatha."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Mr. Peabody, she decided, would be short and
round, with twinkling blue eyes and perhaps a
white stubby beard. He would probably call her
"Sis," and would always be studying how to make
things about the house comfortable for his wife.</p>

<p>"I hope they have horses and pigs and cows
and sheep," mused Betty, the flying landscape
slipping past her window unheeded. "And if
they have sheep, they'll have a dog. Wouldn't I
love to have a dog to take long walks with! And,
of course, there will be a flower garden. 'Bramble
Farm' sounds like a bed of roses to me."</p>

<p>The idea of roses persisted, and while Betty
outwardly was strictly attentive to the things
about her, giving up her ticket at the proper time,
drinking the cocoa and eating the sandwich the
porter brought her (on Uncle Dick's orders she
learned) at eleven o'clock, she was in reality busy
picturing a white farmhouse set in the center of
a rose garden, with a hedge of hollyhocks dividing
it from a scarcely less beautiful and orderly vegetable
kingdom.</p>

<p>Day dreams, she was soon to learn.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<small>THE POORHOUSE RAT</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> next station's yours, Miss," said the porter,
breaking in on Betty's reflections. "Any small
luggage? No? All right, I'll see that you get
off safely."</p>

<p>Betty gathered up her coat and stuffed the
magazine she had bought from the train boy,
but scarcely glanced at, into her bag. Then she
carefully put on her pretty grey silk gloves and
tried to see her face in the mirror of the little
fitted purse. She wanted to look nice when the
Peabodys first saw her.</p>

<p>The train jarred to a standstill.</p>

<p>Betty hurried down the aisle to find the porter
waiting for her with his little step. She was the
only person to leave the train at Hagar's Corners,
and, happening to glance down the line of cars,
she saw her trunk, the one solitary piece of baggage,
tumbled none too gently to the platform.</p>

<p>The porter with his step swung aboard the
train which began to move slowly out. Betty felt
unaccountably small and deserted standing there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and as the platform of the last car swept past her,
she was conscious of a lump in her throat.</p>

<p>"Hello!" blurted an oddly attractive voice at
her shoulder, a boy's voice, shy and brusque but
with a sturdy directness that promised strength
and honesty.</p>

<p>The blue eyes into which Betty turned to look
were honest, too, and the shock of tow-colored
hair and the half-embarrassed grin that displayed
a set of uneven, white teeth instantly prepossessed
the girl in favor of the speaker. There was a
splash of brown freckles across the snub nose,
and the tanned cheeks and blue overalls told
Betty that a country lad stood before her.</p>

<p>"Hello!" she said politely. "You're from Mr.
Peabody's, aren't you? Did they send you to
meet me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Peabody said I was to fetch you,"
replied the boy. "I knew it was you, 'cause no
one else got off the train. If you'll give me your
trunk check I'll help the agent put it in the
wagon. He locks up and goes off home in a little
while."</p>

<p>Betty produced the check and the boy disappeared
into the little one-room station. The girl
for the first time looked about her. Hagar's
Corners, it must be confessed, was not much of
a place, if one judged from the station. The
station itself was not much more than a shanty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
sadly in need of paint and minus the tiny patch
of green lawn that often makes the least pretentious
railroad station pleasant to the eye. Cinders
filled in the road and the ground about the
platform. Hitched to a post Betty now saw a thin
sorrel horse harnessed to a dilapidated spring
wagon with a board laid across it in lieu of a
seat. To her astonishment, she saw her trunk
lifted into this wagon by the station agent and
the boy who had spoken to her.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, it doesn't look very comfortable,"
said Betty to herself. "I wonder if that's
the best wagon Mr. Peabody has? But perhaps
his good horses are busy, or the carriage is broken
or something."</p>

<p>The boy unhitched the sorry nag and drove up
to the platform where Betty was waiting. His
face flushed under his tan as he jumped down to
help her in.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it isn't nice enough for you," he
said, glancing with evident admiration at Betty's
frock. "I spread that salt bag on the seat so
you wouldn't get rust from the nails in that board
on your dress. I'm awfully sorry I haven't a robe
to put over your lap."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm all right," Betty hastened to assure
him tactfully. Then, with a desire to put him at
his ease, "Where is the town?" she asked.</p>

<p>They had turned from the station straight into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
a country road, and Betty had not seen a single
house.</p>

<p>"Hagar's Corners is just a station," explained
the lad. "Mostly milk is shipped from it. All
the trading is done at Glenside. There's stores
and schools and a good-sized town there. Mr.
Peabody had you come to Hagar's Corners 'cause
it's half a mile nearer than Glenside. The horse
has lost a shoe, and he doesn't want to run up a
blacksmith's bill till the foot gets worse than
it is."</p>

<p>Betty's brown eyes widened with amazement.</p>

<p>"That horse is limping now," she said severely,
"Do you mean to tell me Mr. Peabody
will let a horse get a sore foot before he'll pay
out a little money to have it shod?"</p>

<p>The boy turned and looked at her with something
smoldering in his face that she did not understand.
Betty was not used to bitterness.</p>

<p>"Joe Peabody," declared the boy impressively,
"would let his own wife go without shoes if he
thought she could get through as much work as
she can with 'em. Look at my feet!" He thrust
out a pair of rough, heavy work shoes, the toes
patched abominably, the laces knotted in half a
dozen places; Betty noticed that the heel of one
was ripped so that the boy's skin showed through.
"Let his horse go to save a blacksmith's bill!"
repeated the lad contemptuously. "I should think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
he would! The only thing that counts with Joe
Peabody in this world is money!"</p>

<p>Betty's heart sank. To what kind of a home
had she come? Her head was beginning to ache,
and the glare of the sun on the white, dusty road
hurt her eyes. She wished that the wagon had
some kind of top, or that the board seat had a
back.</p>

<p>"Is it very much further?" she asked wearily.</p>

<p>"I'll bet you're tired," said the boy quickly.
"We've a matter of three miles to go yet. The
sorrel can't make extra good time even when he
has a fair show, but I aim to favor his sore foot
if I do get dished out of my dinner."</p>

<p>"I'm so hungry," declared Betty, restored to
vivacity at the thought of luncheon. "All I had
on the train was a cup of chocolate and a sandwich.
Aren't you hungry, too?"</p>

<p>"Considering that all I've had since breakfast
at six this morning, is an apple I stole while hunting
through the orchard for the turkeys, I'll say
I'm starved," admitted the boy. "But I'll have
to wait till six to-night, and so will you."</p>

<p>"But I haven't had any lunch!" Betty protested
vigorously. "Of course, Mrs. Peabody will let
me have something&mdash;perhaps they'll wait for
me."</p>

<p>The boy pulled on the lines mechanically as the
sorrel stumbled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"If that horse once goes down, he'll die in the
road and that'll be the first rest he's known in
seven years," he said cryptically. "No, Miss,
the Peabodys won't wait for you. They wouldn't
wait for their own mother, and that's a fact.
Don't I remember seeing the old lady, who was
childish the year before she died, crying up in her
room because no one had called her to breakfast
and she came down too late to get any? Mrs.
Peabody puts dinner on the table at twelve sharp,
and them as aren't there have to wait till the next
meal. Joe Peabody counts it that much food
saved, and he's got no intentions of having late-comers
gobble it up."</p>

<p>Betty Gordon's straight little chin lifted. Meekness
was not one of her characteristics, and her
fighting spirit rose to combat with small encouragement.</p>

<p>"My uncle's paying my board, and I intend to
eat," she announced firmly. "But maybe I'm upsetting
the household by coming so late in the
afternoon; only there was no other train till night.
I have some chocolate and crackers in my bag&mdash;suppose
we eat those now?"</p>

<p>"Gee, that will be corking!" the fresh voice of
the boy beside her was charged with fervent appreciation.
"There's a spring up the road a
piece, and we'll stop and get a drink. Chocolate
sure will taste good."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Betty was quicker to observe than most girls
of her age, her sorrow having taught her to see
other people's troubles. As the boy drew rein
at the spring and leaped down to bring her a drink
from its cool depths, she noticed how thin he was
and how red and calloused were his hands.</p>

<p>"Thank you." She smiled, giving back the cup.
"That's the coldest water I ever tasted. I'm all
cooled off now."</p>

<p>He climbed up beside her again, and the wagon
creaked on its journey. As Betty divided the
chocolate and crackers, unobtrusively giving her
driver the larger portion, she suggested that he
might tell her his name.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know I'm Betty Gordon," she
said. "You've probably heard Mrs. Peabody say
she went to school with my Uncle Dick. Tell
me who you are, and then we'll be introduced."</p>

<p>The mouth of the boy twisted curiously, and
a sullen look came into the blue eyes.</p>

<p>"You can do without knowing me," he said
shortly. "But so long as you'll hear me yelled
at from sun-up to sun-down, I might as well make
you acquainted with my claims to greatness. I'm
the 'poorhouse rat'&mdash;now pull your blue skirt
away."</p>

<p>"You have no right to talk like that," Betty
asserted quietly. "I haven't given you the slightest
reason to. And if you are really from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
poorhouse, you must be an orphan like me. Can't
we be good friends? Besides, I don't know your
name even yet."</p>

<p>The boy looked at the sweet girl face and his
own cleared.</p>

<p>"I'm a pig!" he muttered with youthful vehemence.
"My name's Bob Henderson, Miss.
I hadn't any call to flare up like that. But living
with the Peabodys doesn't help a fellow when it
comes to manners. And I am from the poorhouse.
Joe Peabody took me when I was ten
years old. I'm thirteen now."</p>

<p>"I'm twelve," said Betty. "Don't call me Miss,
it sounds so stiff. I'm Betty. Oh, dear, how
dreadfully lame that horse is!"</p>

<p>The poor beast was limping, and in evident
pain. Bob Henderson explained that there was
nothing they could do except to let him walk
slowly and try to keep him on the soft edge of
the road.</p>

<p>"He'll have to go five miles to-morrow to Glenside
to the blacksmith's," he said moodily. "I'm
ashamed to drive a horse through the town in
the shape this one's in."</p>

<p>Betty thought indignantly that she would write
to the S. P. C. A. They must have agents
throughout the country, she knew, and surely it
could not be within the law for any farmer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
allow his horse to suffer as the sorrel was plainly
suffering.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Peabody poor, Bob?" she ventured
timidly. "I'm sure Uncle Dick thought Bramble
Farm a fine, large place. He wanted me to learn
to ride horseback this summer."</p>

<p>"Have to be on a saw-horse," replied Bob ironically.
"You bet Peabody isn't poor! Some say
he's worth a hundred thousand if he's worth a
penny. But close&mdash;say, that man's so close he
puts every copper through the wringer. You've
come to a sweet place, and no mistake, Betty. I'm
kind of sorry to see a girl get caught in the Peabody
maw."</p>

<p>"I won't stay 'less I like it," declared Betty
quickly. "I'll write to Uncle Dick, and you can
come, too, Bob. Why are we turning in here?"</p>

<p>"This," said Bob Henderson pointing with his
whip dramatically, "is Bramble Farm."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>BRAMBLE FARM</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wagon was rattling down a narrow lane,
for though the horse went at a snail's pace, every
bolt and hinge in the wagon was loose and contributed
its own measure of noise to their progress.
Betty looked about her with interest. On
either side of the lane lay rolling fertile fields&mdash;in
the highest state of cultivation, had she known
it. Bramble Farm was famed for its good crops,
and whatever people said of its master, the charge
of poor farming was never laid at his door. The
lane turned abruptly into a neglected driveway,
and this led them up to the kitchen door of the
farmhouse.</p>

<p>"Never unlocks the front door 'cept for the
minister or your funeral," whispered Bob in an
aside to Betty, as the kitchen door opened and a
tall, thin man came out.</p>

<p>"Took you long enough to get here," he greeted
the two young people sourly. "Dinner's been
over two hours and more. Hustle that trunk
inside, you Bob, and put up the horse. Wapley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and Lieson need you to help 'em set tomato
plants."</p>

<p>Betty had climbed down and stood helplessly
beside the wagon. Mr. Peabody, for she judged
the tall, thin man must be the owner of Bramble
Farm, though he addressed no word directly to
her and Bob was too evidently subdued to attempt
any introduction, but swung on his heel and
strode off in the direction of the barn. There
was nothing for Betty to do but to follow Bob
and her trunk into the house.</p>

<p>The kitchen was hot and swarming with flies.
There were no screens at the windows, and though
the shades were drawn down, the pests easily
found their way into the room.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Betty? I hope your trip was
pleasant. Dinner's all put away, but it won't be
long till supper time. I'm just trying to brush
some of the flies out," and to Betty's surprise a
thin flaccid hand was thrust into hers. Mrs.
Peabody was carrying out her idea of a handshake.</p>

<p>Betty stared in wonder at the lifeless creature
who smiled wanly at her. What would Uncle
Dick say if he saw Agatha Peabody now? Where
were the long yellow braids and the blue eyes he
had described? This woman, thin, absolutely
colorless in face, voice and manner, dressed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
faded, cheap, blue calico wrapper&mdash;was this Uncle
Dick's old school friend?</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd like to go upstairs to your
room and lie down a while," Mrs. Peabody was
saying. "I'll show you where you're to sleep.
How did you leave your uncle, dear?"</p>

<p>Betty answered dully that he was well. Her
mind was too taken up with new impressions to
know very clearly what was said to her.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry there aren't any screens," apologized
her hostess. "But the flies aren't bad on
this side of the house, and the mosquitoes only
come when there's a marsh wind. You'll find
water in the pitcher, and I laid out a clean towel
for you. Do you want I should help you unpack
your trunk?"</p>

<p>Betty declined the offer with thanks, for she
wanted to be alone. She had not noticed Mrs.
Peabody's longing glance at the smart little trunk,
but later she was to understand that that afternoon
she had denied a real heart hunger for
handling pretty clothes and the dainty accessories
that women love.</p>

<p>When the door had closed on Mrs. Peabody,
Betty sat down on the bed to think. She found
herself in a long, narrow room with two windows,
the sashes propped up with sticks. The floor was
bare and scrubbed very clean and the sheets and
pillow cases on the narrow iron bed, though of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
coarse unbleached muslin, were immaculate.
Something peculiar about the pillow case made
her lean closer to examine it. It was made of
flour or salt bags, overcasted finely together!</p>

<p>"'Puts every copper through the wringer.'"
The phrase Bob had used came to Betty.</p>

<p>"There's no excuse for such things if he isn't
poor," she argued indignantly. "Well, I suppose
I'll have to stay a week, anyway. I might as
well wash."</p>

<p>A half hour later, the traces of travel removed
and her dark frock changed to a pretty pink
chambray dress, Betty descended the stairs to
begin her acquaintance with Bramble Farm. She
wandered through several darkened rooms on the
first floor and out into the kitchen without finding
Mrs. Peabody. A heavy-set, sullen-faced man
was getting a drink from the tin dipper at the
sink.</p>

<p>"Want some?" he asked, indicating the pump.</p>

<p>Betty declined, and asked if he knew where
Mrs. Peabody was.</p>

<p>"Out in the chicken yard," was the reply. "You
the boarder they been talking about?"</p>

<p>"I'm Betty Gordon," said the girl pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, they've been going on for a week about
you. Old man's got it all figured out what he'll
do with your board. The missis rather thought
she ought to have half, but he shut her up mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
quick. Women and money don't hitch up in Peabody's
mind."</p>

<p>He laughed coarsely and went out, drawing a
plug of tobacco from his hip pocket and taking a
tremendous chew from it as he closed the door.</p>

<p>Betty felt a sudden longing for fresh air, and,
waiting only for the man to get out of sight, she
stepped out on the back porch. A regiment of
milk pans were drying in the late afternoon sun
and a churn turned up to air showed that Mrs.
Peabody made her own butter. Betty was still
hungry, and the thought of slices of home-made
bread and golden country butter smote her tantalizingly.</p>

<p>"I wonder where the chicken yard is," she
thought, going down to the limp gate that swung
disconsolately on a rusty hinge.</p>

<p>The Bramble Farm house, she discovered, looking
at it critically, was apparently suffering for
the minor repairs that make a home attractive.
The blinds sagged in several places and in some
instances were missing altogether; once white, the
paint was now a dirty gray; half the pickets were
gone from the garden fence; the lawn was ragged
and overgrown with weeds; and the two discouraged-looking
flower-beds were choked this early
in the season. Betty's weeding habits moved her
irresistibly to kneel down and try to free a few of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the plants from the mass of tangled creepers that
flourished among them.</p>

<p>"Better not let Joe Peabody see you doing
that," said Bob Henderson's voice above her bent
head. "He hasn't a mite of use for a person who
wastes time on flower-beds. If you want to see
things in good shape, take a look at the vegetable
gardens. The missis has to keep that clear,
'cause after it's once planted, she's supposed to
feed us all summer from it."</p>

<p>Betty shook back her hair from a damp forehead.</p>

<p>"For mercy's sake," she demanded with heat,
"is there one pleasant, kind thing connected with
this place? Who was that awful man I met in
the kitchen?"</p>

<p>"Guess it was Lieson, one of the hired men,"
replied Bob. "He came down to the house to get
a drink a few minutes ago. He's all right, Betty,
though not much to look at."</p>

<p>"You, Bob!" came a stentorian shout that shot
Bob through the gate and in the general direction
of the voice with a speed that was little less than
astonishing.</p>

<p>Betty stood up, shook the earth from her skirt,
and, guided by the shrill cackle of a proud hen,
picked her way through a rather cluttered barn-yard
till she came to a wire-enclosed space that
was the chicken yard. Mrs. Peabody, staggering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
under the weight of two heavy pails of water,
met her at the gate.</p>

<p>"How nice you look!" she said wistfully.
"Don't come in here, dear; you might get something
on your dress."</p>

<p>"Oh, it washes," returned Betty carelessly. "Do
you carry water for the chickens?"</p>

<p>"Twice a day in summer," was the answer.
"Before Joe, Mr. Peabody, had water put in
the barns, it was an awful job; but he couldn't get
a man to help him with the cows unless he had
running water at the barn, so this system was
new last year. It's a big help."</p>

<p>Silently, and feeling in the way because she
could not help, Betty watched the woman fill
troughs and drinking vessels for the parched hens
that had evidently spent an uncomfortable and
dry afternoon in the shadeless yard. Scattering
a meager ration of corn, Mrs. Peabody went into
the hen house and reappeared presently with a
basket filled with eggs.</p>

<p>"They'd lay better if I could get 'em some meat
scraps," she confided to Betty as they walked toward
the house. "But I dunno&mdash;it's so hard to
get things done, I've about given up arguing."</p>

<p>She would not let Betty help her with the supper,
and was so insistent that she should not touch
a dish that Betty yielded, though reluctantly.
The heat of the kitchen was intense, for Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Peabody had built a fire of corn cobs in the range.
Gas, of course, there was none, and she evidently
had not an oil stove or a fireless cooker.</p>

<p>Precisely at six o'clock the men came in.</p>

<p>"They milk after supper, summers," Mrs. Peabody
had explained. "The milk stays sweet
longer."</p>

<p>Betty watched in round-eyed amazement as
Mr. Peabody and the two hired men washed at
the sink, with much sputtering and blowing, and
combed their hair before a small cracked mirror
tacked over the sink. If she had not been very
hungry, she was sure the sight would have taken
her appetite away. Bob did not come in till they
were seated. He had washed outside, he explained,
and Betty cherished the idea that perhaps
he had acted out of consideration for her.</p>

<p>"What's that?" demanded Mr. Peabody, pointing
his fork at a tiny pat of butter before Betty's
plate.</p>

<p>There was no other butter on the table, and
only a very plain meal of bread, fried potatoes,
raspberries and hot tea.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I had a little butter left over from the
last churning," faltered Mrs. Peabody. "'Twasn't
enough to make even a quarter-pound print, Joe."</p>

<p>"Don't believe it," contradicted her husband.
"I told you flat, Agatha, that there was to be
no pampering. Betty can eat what we eat, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
go without. Take that butter off, do you hear
me?"</p>

<p>A sallow flush rose to Mrs. Peabody's thin
cheeks, and her lips moved rebelliously. Evidently
her husband was practiced at reading her
soundless words.</p>

<p>"Board?" he cried belligerently. "What do I
care whether she's paying board or not? Don't
I have to be the judge of how the house should
be run? Food was never higher than 'tis now,
and you've got to watch every scrap. You take
that butter off and don't let me catch you doing
nothin' like that again."</p>

<p>The men were eating stolidly, evidently too
used to quarrels to pay any attention to anything
but their food. Betty had listened silently, but
the bread she ate seemed to choke her. Suddenly
she rose to her feet, shaking with rage.</p>

<p>"Take your old butter!" she stormed at the
astonished Mr. Peabody. "I wouldn't eat it, if
you begged me to. And I won't stay in your
house one second longer than it takes to have
Uncle Dick send for me&mdash;you&mdash;you old miserable
miser!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<small>BETTY MAKES UP HER MIND</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> had a confused picture of Mr. Peabody
staring at her, his fork arrested half way to his
mouth, before she dashed from the kitchen and
fled to her room. She flung herself on the bed
and burst into tears.</p>

<p>She lay there for a long time, sobbing uncontrollably
and more unhappy than she had ever
been in her short life. She missed her mother
and father intolerably, she longed for the kindness
of the good, if querulous, Mrs. Arnold and
the comfort of Uncle Dick's tenderness and protection.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't want me to stay here, I know he
wouldn't!" she whispered stormily. "He never
would have let me come if he had known what
kind of a place Bramble Farm is. I'll write to
him to-night."</p>

<p>A low whistle came to her. She ran to the
window.</p>

<p>"Sh! Got a piece of string?" came a sibilant
whisper. Bob Henderson peered up at her from
around a lilac bush. "I brought you some bread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
with raspberries mashed between it. Let down
a cord and I'll tie it on."</p>

<p>"I'll come down," said Betty promptly. "Can't
we take a walk? It looks awfully pretty up the
lane."</p>

<p>"I have to clean two more horses and bed
down a sick cow and carry slops to the pigs yet,"
recited Bob in a matter of fact way, as though
these few little duties were commonly performed
at the close of his long day. "After that, though,
we might go a little way. It won't be dark."</p>

<p>"Well, whistle when you're ready," directed
Betty. "I won't come down and run the risk of
having to talk to Mr. Peabody. And save me
the bread!"</p>

<p>It seemed a long time before Bob whistled, and
the gray summer dusk was deepening when Betty
ran down to join him. He handed her the bread,
wrapped in a bit of clean paper, diffidently.</p>

<p>"I didn't touch it with my hands," he assured
her.</p>

<p>Bob's face was shining from a vigorous scrubbing
and his hair was plastered tight to his head
and still wet. He had so evidently tried to make
himself neat and his poor frayed overalls and
ridiculous shoes made the task so hopeless that
Betty was divided between pity for him and anger
at the Peabodys who could treat a member
of their household so shabbily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess you kind of shook the old man up,"
commented Bob, unconscious of her thoughts.
"For half a minute after you slammed the door,
he sat there in a daze. Mrs. Peabody wanted to
take some supper up to you, but he wouldn't let
her. She's deathly afraid of him."</p>

<p>"Did he ever hit her?" asked Betty, horrified.</p>

<p>"No, I don't know that he ever did. He
doesn't have to hit her; his talk is worse. They
say she used to answer back, but I never heard
her open her mouth to argue with him, and I've
been here three years."</p>

<p>"Do they pay you well?"</p>

<p>The boy looked at Betty sharply.</p>

<p>"I thought you were kidding," he said frankly.
"Poorhouse children don't get paid. We get our
board till we're eighteen. We're not supposed
to do enough work to cover more'n that. Just
the same, I do as much as Wapley or Leison, any
day."</p>

<p>Betty walked along eating her bread and wondering
about Bob Henderson. Who, she speculated,
had been his father and mother, and how
had he happened to find himself in the poorhouse?
And why, oh, why, should such a boy have had
the bad luck to be "taken" by a man like Mr.
Peabody? Betty was a courteous girl, and she
could not bring herself to ask Bob these questions
pointblank, however her curiosity urged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
her. Perhaps when they were better acquainted,
she might have a chance. But that thought suggested
to Betty her letter.</p>

<p>"I'm going to write to Uncle Dick before I go
to bed to-night," she announced. "He said I
needn't stay if for any good reason I found I
wasn't happy here. I can't stay, Bob, honestly I
can't. He wouldn't want me to. Shall I ask him
about a place for you? And where do I mail my
letter?"</p>

<p>Bob Henderson's face fell. He had hoped that
this bright, pretty girl, with her independent and
friendly manner, might spend the summer at
Bramble Farm. Bob had been so long cut off
from communication with a companion of his own
age that it was a perfect luxury for him to have
Betty to talk to. Still, he could not help admitting,
the Peabody circle had nothing to offer
Betty.</p>

<p>"Don't mail your letter in the box at the end of
the lane," he advised her. "Joe Peabody might
see it and take it out. I'll take it to Glenside with
me to-morrow&mdash;unless you want to go along?
Say, that would be great, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>Betty liked the idea, and so before they turned
back to the house they arranged to mail the letter
secretly in Glenside the following morning.
Immensely cheered, Betty went in to write to her
uncle and Bob disappeared up the stairs to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
attic, where he and the two hired men shared
quarters.</p>

<p>It was too dark to see clearly in her room, and
after Betty had groped around in a vain hunt for
a lamp and matches, she went down to the kitchen
intending to ask for a light.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peabody stood at the table, mixing something
in a pan, and a small glass lamp gave the
room all the light it had.</p>

<p>"I'm setting my bread," the woman explained,
as Betty came in. "Where have you been dear?
You must be hungry."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not hungry," answered Betty, avoiding
explanations. "I've been out for a little walk.
May I have a lamp Mrs. Peabody?"</p>

<p>Her hostess glanced round to make sure that
the door was shut.</p>

<p>"You can take this one in just a minute," she
said, indicating the small lamp on the table. "Mr.
Peabody's gone up to bed. You see we don't
use lights much in summer&mdash;we go to bed early
'cause all hands have to be up at half-past four.
And lamps brings the mosquitoes."</p>

<p>Betty sat down in a chair to wait for her lamp.
She was tired from her journey and the exciting
events of the day, but she had made up her mind
to write to her uncle that night, and her mind
made up, Betty was sure to stick to it.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to bed?" asked Betty, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
up the lamp when Mrs. Peabody had finished.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peabody made no move to leave the kitchen.</p>

<p>"I like to sit out on the back stoop awhile and
get cooled off," she said. "Sometimes I go to
sleep leaning against the post, and one night I
didn't wake up till morning and Bob Henderson
fell over me running out for wood to start the fire.
I like to sit quiet. Sometimes I wish I had a dog
to keep me company, but Mr. Peabody don't like
dogs."</p>

<p>Betty went back to her room and began her
letter. But all the while she was writing the
thought of that lonely woman "sitting quiet" on
the doorstep haunted her. What a life! And
she had probably looked forward to happiness
with her husband and home as all girls do.</p>

<p>The mosquitoes were singing madly about the
light before the first five minutes had passed, but
Betty stuck it out and sealed and addressed her
letter, putting it under her pillow for safe keeping.
Then she blew out the light and undressed
in the dark. The bed was the hardest thing she
had ever lain upon, but, being a healthy young
person and very tired, she fell asleep as quickly
as though the mattress had been filled with softest
down and only wakened when a shaft of sunlight
fell across her face. Some one was whistling
softly beneath her window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Seizing her dressing gown and flinging it across
her shoulders, Betty peered out. Bob Henderson,
swinging a milk pail in either hand, was back of
the lilac bush again.</p>

<p>"Say, it's quarter of six," he called anxiously,
as he saw Betty's face at the window. "Breakfast
is at six, and if you don't hurry you'll be
cheated out of that. I'm going to Glenside right
after, too."</p>

<p>"I'll hurry," promised Betty. "Thank you
for telling me. Have you been up long?"</p>

<p>"Hour and a half," came the nonchalant answer
as Bob hurried on to the barn.</p>

<p>Betty sat down on the floor to put on her shoes
and stockings. At first she was angry to think
that she should be made to rush like this in order
to have any breakfast when her uncle was
paying her board and in any other household she
would have been accorded some consideration as
a guest. Then the humor of the situation appealed
to her and she laughed till the tears came.
She, Betty Gordon, who often had to be called
three times in the morning, was scrambling into
her clothes at top speed in the hope of securing
something to eat.</p>

<p>"It's too funny!" she gasped as she pulled a
middy blouse on over her head. "I'll bet the Peabody's
never have to call any one twice to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to the table; not if they're within hearing distance.
They come first call without coaxing."</p>

<p>The breakfast table was set in the kitchen, and
when Betty entered Mrs. Peabody was putting
small white saucers of oatmeal at each place. Ordinarily
Betty did not care for oatmeal in warm
weather, but this morning she was in no mood
to quarrel with anything eatable and she dispatched
her portion almost as quickly as Bob did
his. Mr. Peabody grunted something which she
took to mean good-morning, and the two hired
men simply nodded to her. After the oatmeal
came fried potatoes, bread without butter, ham
and coffee. There was no milk to drink and no
eggs.</p>

<p>"If I was going to stay," thought Betty to herself,
"I'd get some stuff over in town and hide it
in my room. I wonder if I couldn't anyway.
When I leave, Bob would have it."</p>

<p>She fell to planning what she would buy and
became as silent as any of the other five at that
queer table.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<small>ONE ON BOB</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as the men finished eating they rose
silently and shuffled out. Any diffidence Betty
might have felt about facing any one at the
table after her dramatic exit of the night before
was speedily dispelled; no one paid the slightest
attention to her. Mrs. Peabody had risen and
begun to wash the dishes at the sink before Betty
had finished.</p>

<p>"I want to ride over to Glenside with Bob,"
said the girl a trifle uncertainly as she pushed
back her chair. "You don't care, do you, Mrs.
Peabody? And can I do any errands for you?"</p>

<p>"No, I dunno as I want anything," said the
woman dully. "You go along and try to enjoy
yourself. Bob's got to get back by eleven to
whitewash the pig house."</p>

<p>"Come, drive over with us this morning," urged
Betty kindly. "I'll help you with the work when
we get back. The air will do you good. You
look as though you had a headache."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have a headache 'most all the time,"
admitted Mrs. Peabody, apparently not thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
it worth discussion. "And I couldn't go to town,
child, I haven't a straw hat. I don't know when
I've been to Glenside. Joe fusses so about the
collection, I gave up going to church two years
ago."</p>

<p>Betty heard the sound of wheels and ran out to
join Bob, an ache in her throat.</p>

<p>"I think it's a burning shame!" she announced
hotly to that youth, as he put out a helpful hand to
pull her up to the seat. "I pity Mrs. Peabody
from the bottom of my heart. Why can't she
have a straw hat? Doesn't she take care of the
poultry and the butter and do all the work in the
house? If she can't have a hat, I'd like to know
why not!"</p>

<p>"Regular pepper-pot, aren't you?" commented
Bob admiringly. "Gee, I wanted to laugh when
you lit into old Peabody last night. Didn't dare,
though&mdash;he'd have up and pasted me one."</p>

<p>It was a beautiful summer morning, and in
spite of injustice and unlovely human traits housed
under the roof they had left, in spite of the
sight of the poor animal before them suffering
pain at every step, the two young people managed
to enjoy themselves. Betty had a hundred questions
to ask about Bramble Farm, and Bob was
in the seventh heaven of delight to have this
friendly, cheerful companion to talk to instead
of only his own thoughts for company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've got the letter to Uncle Dick here in my
pocket," Betty was saying as they came in sight
of the blacksmith's shop on the outskirts of Glenside.
"I suppose I'll have to be patient about
waiting for an answer. It may take a week. I
don't know just where he is, but I've written to the
address he gave me, and marked it 'Please forward.'"</p>

<p>The blacksmith came out and took the horse,
Bob helping him unharness and Betty improving
the opportunity to see the inside of a smithy.</p>

<p>"I guess you'll want to look around town a
bit?" suggested Bob, coming up to her when the
sorrel was tied in place awaiting his turn to be
shod. Two other horses were before him. "I'll
wait here for you."</p>

<p>Betty looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, Bob Henderson!" she ejaculated, keeping
her voice low so that the two or three loungers
about the door could not hear. "Are you
willing to let me go around by myself in a perfectly
strange town? I don't even know my way
to the post-office. Don't you want to go with
me?"</p>

<p>Bob was evidently embarrassed.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I don't look fit!" he blurted out. "The
collar's torn off this shirt, and I get only one clean
pair of overalls a week&mdash;Monday morning. I
don't look good enough to go round with you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't be silly!" said Betty severely. "You
look all right for a work day. Come on, or we
won't be back by the time the shoe is on."</p>

<p>Between the shop and the town there was a
rather deserted strip of land, very conspicuous as
to concrete walks and building lots marked off, but
rather lacking in actual houses. Betty seized her
opportunity to do a little tactful financiering. She
knew that Bob had no money of his own&mdash;indeed
it was doubtful if the lad had ever handled
even small change that he was not accountable
for.</p>

<p>"Uncle Dick gave me some money to spend,"
remarked Betty, rather hurriedly, for she did not
know how Bob was going to take what she meant
to say. "And before you show me the different
stores, I want you to take me to the drug
store. I'm going to buy Mrs. Peabody the largest
bottle of violet toilet water I can find. It will
do her headache heaps of good. If I give you
the money, you'll buy it for me, won't you Bob?"</p>

<p>"Sure I will," agreed the unsuspecting Bob, and
he pocketed the five dollar bill she gave him readily
enough.</p>

<p>The wily Betty hoped that the drug store would
be modern, for she had a plan tucked up her white
sleeve.</p>

<p>"Want to go to the drug store first or to the
post-office?" asked Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, the post-office!" Betty was suddenly
anxious to know that her letter was actually on
the way.</p>

<p>"Don't forget&mdash;get a big bottle," said Betty
warningly, as she and Bob entered the drug store.</p>

<p>Her dancing dark eyes discovered what she
had hoped for the moment they were inside the
screen door&mdash;a large soda fountain with a white-jacketed
clerk behind it.</p>

<p>Bob led the way to the perfume counter, and
though the clerk, who evidently knew him, seemed
surprised at his order, he very civilly set out several
bottles of toilet water for their inspection.
Betty chose a handsome large bottle, and when it
was wrapped, and with it some soap, for Betty
did not fancy the thin wafer of yellow kitchen
soap she had found in her soapdish, Bob paid for
the package and received the change quite as
though he were accustomed to such proceedings.
Indeed he stood straighter, and Betty knew she
was right in her conclusions that he had sensitiveness
and pride.</p>

<p>The time had come to put her plan into action.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bob!" She pulled his coat sleeve as they
were passing the fountain on their way out.
"Let's have a sundae!"</p>

<p>The clerk had heard her, and he came forward
at once, pushing toward them a printed card with
the names of the drinks served. Bob opened his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
mouth, then closed it. He sat down on one of the
high stools and Betty on another.</p>

<p>"I'll have a chocolate marshmallow nut sundae,"
ordered Betty composedly, having selected
the most expensive and fanciful concoction listed
with the fervent hope that it would be plentiful
and good.</p>

<p>"I'll have the same," mumbled Bob, just as
Betty had trusted he would.</p>

<p>While the clerk was mixing the delectable
dainty, Betty stole a look at Bob. His mouth was
set grimly. Then he turned and caught her eye.
An unwilling grin flickered across his face and
he capitulated as Betty broke into a delighted
giggle.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be jiggered!" admitted Bob, "you've
certainly put it over on me."</p>

<p>They laughed and chattered over the sundaes,
and Betty, when they were gone, would not listen
to reason, but insisted they must have another.
She did not want a second one, but she knew Bob's
longing for sweets must have gone ungratified a
long time, and she was too young to worry about
the ultimate effect on his surprised organs of digestion.
Bob was fairly caught, and could not
object without putting himself in an unfavorable
light with the impressive young clerk, so two more
sundaes were ordered and disposed of. Then Bob
paid for them from the change in his pocket and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
he and Betty found themselves on the sunny sidewalk.</p>

<p>"That's the first sundae I ever had," confessed
Bob shyly. "Of course we had ice-cream at the
poorhouse sometimes for a treat&mdash;Christmas and
sometimes Fourth of July. But I never ate a
sundae. Do you want your change back now?"</p>

<p>"No, keep it," said Betty. "I want to go to a
grocery store now. And where do they keep mosquito
netting?"</p>

<p>"Same place&mdash;Liscom's general store," answered
Bob.</p>

<p>The general store was well-named. Betty, who
had never been in a place of this kind, was fascinated
by the shelves and the wonderful assortment
of goods they contained. Everything, she
privately decided, from a pink chiffon veil to a
keg of nails could be bought here, and her deductions
were very near the truth.</p>

<p>"I can't stand being chewed by the mosquitoes
another night," she whispered to Bob. "So I'm
going to get some netting and tack it on the window
casings. I'd buy a lamp if I was going to
stay."</p>

<p>After the netting was measured off, Betty, to
Bob's astonishment, began to buy groceries. She
chose cans of sardines and tuna fish, several packages
of fancy crackers, a bottle or two of olives,
a pound of dried apricots, a box of dates and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
or two other articles. These were all wrapped
together in a neat bundle.</p>

<p>"Do they make sandwiches here?" asked
Betty, watching a machine shaving off a pink slice
of cold boiled ham and a layer of cheese and the
storekeeper's assistant butter two slabs of bread
with sweet-looking butter at the order of a teamster
who stood waiting.</p>

<p>"Sure we do, Miss," the proprietor assured
her. "Nice, fresh sandwiches made while you
wait, and wrapped in waxed paper."</p>

<p>"I'll have two ham and two cheese, please,"
responded Betty, adding in an aside to Bob: "We
can eat 'em going home."</p>

<p>She was afraid that perhaps she had spent
more money than she had left from the five dollar
bill. But Bob had enough to pay for her purchases,
it seemed, and they left the store with
their bundles, well pleased with the morning's
work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<small>ROAD COURTESY</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">We'll</span> have to hurry," said Bob, quickening
his steps, "if I'm to get back at eleven. I hope
Turner has the sorrel ready."</p>

<p>"Hasn't the horse a name?" queried Betty curiously,
running to keep up with Bob. "I must
go out and see the cows and things. Do you like
pigs, Bob?"</p>

<p>The boy laughed a little at this confusion of
ideas.</p>

<p>"No, none of the horses are named," he answered,
taking the questions in order. "Peabody
has three; but we just call 'em the sorrel and the
black and the bay. Nobody's got time to feed
'em lumps of sugar and make pets out of them.
Guess that's what you've got in mind, Betty. Old
Peabody would throw a fit if he saw any one feeding
sugar to a horse."</p>

<p>"But the cows?" urged Betty. "Do they get
enough to eat? Or do they have to suffer to save
money, like this poor horse we brought over to
be shod?"</p>

<p>"Cows," announced Bob sententiously, "are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
different A cow won't give as much milk if
she's bothered, and Joe Peabody can see a butter
check as far as anybody else. So the stables are
screened and the cows are fed pretty well. Now,
of course, they're out on pasture. They're not
blood stock, though&mdash;just mixed breeds. And I
hate pigs!"</p>

<p>Betty was surprised at his vehemence, but she
had no chance to ask for an explanation, for by
this time they had reached the smithy, and the
blacksmith led out the sorrel.</p>

<p>After they were well started on their way
toward the farm, she ventured to ask Bob why he
hated pigs.</p>

<p>"If you had to take care of 'em, you'd know
why," he answered moodily. "I'd like to drown
every one of 'em in the pails of slop I've carried
out to 'em. And whitewashing the pig house on
a hot day&mdash;whew! The pigs can go out in the
orchard and root around, while I have to clean
up after 'em. Besides, if you lived on ham for
breakfast the year round, you'd hate the sight of
a pig!"</p>

<p>Betty laughed understandingly.</p>

<p>"I know I should," she agreed. "Isn't it funny,
I never thought so much about eating in my life
as I have since I've been here. It's on my mind
continually. I bought this canned stuff to keep up
in my room so if I don't want to eat what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Peabodys have every meal I needn't. You can
have some, too, Bob. Let's eat these sandwiches
now&mdash;I'm hungry, aren't you? Why didn't you
tell me you were tired of ham and I would have
bought something else?"</p>

<p>But Bob was far from despising well-cooked
cold, boiled ham, and he thoroughly enjoyed his
share of the sandwiches. While eating he glanced
once or twice uncertainly at Betty, wishing he
could find the courage to tell her how glad he was
that she had come to Bramble Farm. Bob's life
had had very few pleasant events in it so far.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it was funny that Mr. Peabody
let me come?" asked Betty presently, following
her own train of thought. "If he's so
close, I should think he'd hate to have any one
come to see his wife."</p>

<p>"He's doing it for the check your uncle sent,"
retorted Bob shrewdly. "Didn't you know your
board was paid for two weeks in advance? That's
why Peabody isn't making a fuss about your going;
he figures he'll be in that much. Hello,
what's this?"</p>

<p>"This" was a buggy drawn up at one side of
the road, the fat, white horse lazily cropping
grass, while two slight feminine figures stood helplessly
by.</p>

<p>Bob was going to drive past, but Betty put out
her hand and jerked the sorrel to a halt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ask 'em what the matter is," she commanded.</p>

<p>"They've lost a wheel," said Bob in a low tone,
his practiced eye having detected at once that one
of the rear wheels was lying on the grass. "We
can't stop, Betty; we're late now, and Joe Peabody's
in a raging temper anyway this morning."</p>

<p>"Why, Bob Henderson, how you do talk!"
Betty's dark eyes began to shoot fire. "Just because
you have to live with the meanest man in
the world is no excuse for you to grow like him!
If you drive on and don't try to help these women,
I'll never speak to you again&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>Bob looked shamefaced. His first impulse had
been to stop and offer help, but he had had first-hand
experience with the Peabody temper and
had endured more than one beating for slight
neglect of iron-clad orders. When he still hesitated,
Betty spoke scornfully.</p>

<p>"They're old ladies&mdash;so don't bother," she said
bitingly. "Uncle Dick says no one should ever
leave any one in trouble on the road, but I suppose
he meant men who could whack you over the
head if you refused to assist them. Why don't
you drive on, Bob?"</p>

<p>"You hush up!" Bob, stung into action, closed
his mouth grimly and handed over the reins to
his tormentor. "It's a half hour's job to put that
wheel on, but I suppose there's no way out of it,
so here goes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The two women were, as Betty had said, old
ladies; that is, each had very white hair. And,
although the day was warm, they were so muffled
up in veils and shawls and gloves that the boy and
the girl marveled how they could see to drive.</p>

<p>"The wheel just came off without warning,"
said the taller of the two, in a high, sweet voice,
as Bob asked to be allowed to help them. "Sister
and I were so frightened! It might have been
serious, you know, but Phyllis is such a good
horse! She never even attempted to run."</p>

<p>Bob with difficulty repressed a grin. Looking
at the fat sides of Phyllis he would have said that
physical handicaps, rather than an inherent sweetness
of disposition, kept Phyllis where she belonged
between the shafts.</p>

<p>"You've lost a nut," announced the boy, after
a brief examination.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" fluttered both ladies. "Isn't
that unfortunate! You haven't a&mdash;a&mdash;nut with
you, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I'm Bob Henderson," said the lad courteously.
"I'll look around here in the dust a bit and
maybe the nut will turn up. Why don't you sit
down in the shade and rest awhile?"</p>

<p>The two ladies accepted his suggestion gratefully.
They retired to a crooked old apple tree
growing on the bank further down the road,
evincing no desire to make the acquaintance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Betty, who sat quietly in the wagon holding the
reins.</p>

<p>"I suppose they think we're backwoods country
folks," thought Betty, the blood coming into her
face. "Don't know that I blame them, seeing
that this wagon is patched and tied together in a
hundred places and the horse looks like a shadow
of a skeleton."</p>

<p>Bob continued to search in the dust of the road
painstakingly. The two women clearly had
shifted their trouble to him, and apparently had
no further interest in the outcome. Betty longed
to offer to help him, but the severity of his profile,
as she glimpsed it now and then, deterred her.</p>

<p>"I wish I could stop before I say so much,"
mourned the girl to herself. "I ought to know
that Bob can't help being afraid of Mr. Peabody.
If he had control over me, I'd probably act just
as his wife and Bob do. When you can get away
from an ogre, it's easy enough to say you're not
afraid of him. Doesn't Bob dominate the situation,
as Mrs. Arnold used to say!"</p>

<p>Bob had found the nut, and was now fitting the
wheel into place, working with a quickness and
skill that fascinated Betty. She timidly called to
him and asked if she should not come and hold
the axle, but he refused her offer curtly. In a
very few minutes the wheel was screwed on and
the two ladies at liberty to resume their journey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
They were insistent that Bob accept pay for his
help, but the boy declined, politely but resolutely,
and seemingly at no loss for diplomatic words and
phrases.</p>

<p>"Were you born in the poorhouse, Bob?" Betty
asked curiously, wondering where the lad had developed
his ability to meet people on their own
ground. The volubly thankful ladies had driven
on, and the sorrel was now trotting briskly toward
Bramble Farm.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was," said Bob shortly. "But my
mother wasn't, nor my father. I've got a box
buried in the garden that's mine, though the
clothes on my back belong to old Peabody. And
if I'm like Joe Peabody in other things, perhaps
I'll learn to make money and save it. My father
couldn't, or I wouldn't have been born in an alms-house!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Bob!" Betty cried miserably, "I didn't
mean you were like Mr. Peabody&mdash;you know I
didn't. I'm so sorry! I always say things I don't
mean when I'm mad. Uncle Dick told me to go
out and chop wood when I get furious, and not
talk. I am so sorry!"</p>

<p>"We've got a wood pile," grinned Bob. "I'll
show you where it is. The rest of it's all right,
Betty. I'd probably have stayed awake all night
if I'd driven by those women. Only I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Peabody will be in a towering rage. It must be
noon."</p>

<p>If Betty was not afraid of Mr. Peabody, it
must be confessed that she looked forward with
no more pleasure than Bob to meeting him. Still
she was not prepared for the cold fury with which
he greeted them when they drove into the yard.</p>

<p>"Just as I figured," he said heavily. "Here
'tis noon, and that boy hasn't done a stroke of
work since breakfast. Gallivanting all over town,
I'll be bound. Going to be like his shiftless,
worthless father and mother&mdash;a charge on the
township all his days. You take that pail of
whitewash and don't let me see you again till you
get the pig house done, you miserable, sneaking
poorhouse rat! You'll go without dinner to pay
for wasting my time like this! Clear out, now."</p>

<p>"How dare you!" Betty's voice was shaking,
but she stood up in the wagon and looked down
at Mr. Peabody bravely. "How dare you taunt
a boy with what he isn't responsible for? It isn't
his fault that he was born in the poorhouse, nor
his fault that we're late. I made him stop and
help put a buggy wheel on. Oh, how can you be
so mean, and close and hateful?"</p>

<p>Betty's eyes overflowed as she gathered up her
bundles and jumped to the ground. Mrs. Peabody,
standing in the doorway, was a silent witness
to her outburst, and the two hired men, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
had come up to the house for dinner, were watching
curiously. Bob had disappeared with the
bucket of whitewash. No one would say anything,
thought Betty despairingly, if a murder
were committed in this awful place.</p>

<p>"Been spending your money?" sneered Mr.
Peabody, eyeing the bundles with disfavor.
"Never earned a cent in your life, I'll be bound,
yet you'll fling what isn't yours right and left.
Let me give you a word of advice, young lady;
as long as you're in my house you hold your
tongue if you don't want to find yourself in your
room on a diet of bread and water. Understand?"</p>

<p>Betty Gordon fled upstairs, her one thought to
reach the haven of her bed. Anger and humiliation
and a sense of having lowered herself to the
Peabody level by quarreling when in a bad temper
swept over her in a wave. She buried her
head in the hard little pillow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<small>A KEEN DISAPPOINTMENT</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I'm</span> just as bad as he is, every bit," sobbed
poor little Betty. "Uncle Dick would say so.
I'm in his house, much as I hate it, and I hadn't
any right to call him names&mdash;only he is so hateful!
Oh, dear, I wonder if I shall ever get away
from here!"</p>

<p>She cried herself into a headache, and had no
heart to open the parcel of groceries or to go
down to ask Mrs. Peabody for something to eat,
though indeed the girl knew she stood small
chance of securing as much as a cracker after the
dinner hour.</p>

<p>Suddenly some one put a soothing hand on her
hot forehead, and, opening her swollen eyes,
Betty saw Mrs. Peabody standing beside the bed.</p>

<p>"You poor lamb!" said the woman compassionately.
"You mustn't go on like this, dear.
You'll make yourself sick. I'm going to close
the blinds and shut out the sun; then I'll get a
cold cloth for your head. You'd feel better if
you had something to eat, though. You mustn't
go without your meals, child."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've got some crackers and bouillon cubes,"
replied Betty wearily. "I suppose Mr. Peabody
wouldn't mind if I used a little hot water from
the tea kettle?"</p>

<p>She bit her tongue with vexation at the sarcasm,
but Mrs. Peabody apparently saw no implication.</p>

<p>"The kitchen fire's gone out, but the kettle's
still hot," she answered. "I'll step down and get
you a cup. I have just ninety cobs to get supper
on, or I'd build up a fresh fire for you. Joe
counts the cobs; he wants they should last till the
first of July."</p>

<p>"Oh, how do you stand it?" burst from Betty.
"I should think you'd go crazy. Don't you ever
want to scream?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Peabody stopped in the doorway.</p>

<p>"I used to care," she admitted apathetically.
"Not any more. You can get used to anything.
Besides, it's no use, Betty; you'll find that out.
Flinging yourself against a stone wall only bruises
you&mdash;the wall doesn't even feel you trying."</p>

<p>"Bring up two cups," called Betty, as Mrs.
Peabody started down stairs.</p>

<p>"I'll bet she flung herself against the stone
wall till all the spirit and life was crushed out of
her," mused the girl, lying flat on her back, her
eyes fixed on the fly-specked ceiling. "Poor soul,
it must be awful to have to give up even trying."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Peabody came back with two cracked
china cups and saucers, and a tea kettle half full
of passably hot water. Betty forgot her throbbing
head as she bustled about, spreading white
paper napkins on the bed&mdash;there was no table
and only one chair in the room&mdash;and arranging
her crackers and a package of saltines which she
deftly spread with potted ham.</p>

<p>"We'll have a make-believe party," she declared
tactfully, dropping a couple of soup cubes
in each cup and adding the hot water. "I'm sure
you're hungry; you jump up so much at the table,
you don't half eat your meals."</p>

<p>Mrs. Peabody raised her eyes&mdash;faded eyes but
still honest.</p>

<p>"I've no more pride left," she said quietly.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" exclaimed Betty, "I bought you
something this morning, and haven't given it to
you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Peabody was as pleased as a child with
the pretty bottle of toilet water, and Betty extracted
a promise from her that she would use it
for her headaches, and not "save" it.</p>

<p>"If I was going to stay," thought Betty, stowing
her packages of goodies under the bed as the
most convenient place presenting itself, "I might
be able to make things a little pleasanter for Mrs.
Peabody. I do wonder when Uncle Dick will
write."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>She had allowed four days as the shortest time
in which her uncle could possibly get an answer
to her, so she was agreeably delighted when, on
going out to the mailbox at the head of the lane
the third morning, she found a letter addressed
to her and postmarked "Philadelphia." There
was no other mail in the box. The Peabodys did
not even subscribe for a weekly paper.</p>

<p>"Bob!" shouted Betty, hurdling a fence and
bearing down upon that youth as he hoed corn in
a near by field. "Bob, here's a letter from Uncle
Dick! He's answered so soon, I'm sure he says
I can come to him. Won't that be great?"</p>

<p>Bob nodded grimly and went on with his work
while Betty eagerly tore open her envelope.
After she had read the first few lines the brightness
went out of her face, and when she looked
up at Bob she was crying.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, is he sick?" asked the boy
in alarm.</p>

<p>"He hasn't had my letter at all!" wept Betty.
"He never got it! This was written the same
day I wrote him, and he says he's going out to
the oil wells and won't be in touch with civilization
for some weeks to come. His lawyer in
Philadelphia is to hold his mail, and send the
checks for my board. And he thinks I'm having
a good time with his old friend Agatha and encloses
a check for ten dollars for me to spend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Oh, Bob!" and the unhappy Betty flung her arms
around the neck of the astonished Bob and cried
as though her heart would break.</p>

<p>"There, there!" Bob patted her awkwardly, in
his excitement hitting her with the hoe handle,
but neither of them knew that. "There, Betty,
maybe things won't be as bad as you think. You
can go to Glenside and get books from the library&mdash;they've
got a right nice little library. It would
be nice if you had a bicycle or something to go
on, but you haven't."</p>

<p>"Uncle's sending me a riding habit," said Betty,
wiping her eyes. "And a whole bundle of books
and a parcel of magazines. He says he never yet
saw a farm with enough reading material on the
parlor table. I will be glad to have something
to read."</p>

<p>"Sure. And Sundays I can borrow a magazine,"
and Bob's eyes shone with anticipated enjoyment.
"Sunday's the one day I have any time
to myself and there's never much to do."</p>

<p>Betty slipped the letter into her blouse pocket.
She was bitterly disappointed to think that she
must stay at Bramble Farm, and she did not relish
the idea of having to confess to the Peabodys that
her plans for leaving them had been rather premature.</p>

<p>"I say," Bob looked up from his hoeing, the
shrewd light in his eyes that made him appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
older than his thirteen years. "I say, Betty, if
you're wise, you won't say anything about this
letter up at the house. Old Peabody doesn't know
you've written to your uncle, and he'll think you
changed your mind. I half believe he thinks you
were only speaking in a fit of temper, anyway.
If you tell him you can't reach your uncle by letter,
and have to stay here for the next few weeks
whether you will or no, he'll think he has you
right where he wants you. He can't help taking
advantage of every one."</p>

<p>"Doesn't any one ever come to call?" Betty
asked a day or two later, following Bob out to
the pasture to help him salt the sheep.</p>

<p>It was a Sunday morning, and even Mr. Peabody
so far respected the Sabbath that he exacted
only half as much as usual from his help. The
milking, of course, had to be done, and the stock
fed, but that accomplished, after breakfast, Wapley
and Lieson, the hired men, had set off to walk
to Glenside to spend their week's wages as they
saw fit. They had long ago, after wordy battles,
learned the futility of trying to borrow a horse
from Mr. Peabody.</p>

<p>Bob had finished his usual chores, and after
salting the sheep would be practically free for the
day. He and Betty had planned to take their
books out into the orchard and enjoy the peaceful
sunniness of the lovely June weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come to call?" repeated Bob, letting down
the bars of the rocky pasture. "What would
they come to call for? No one would be civil to
'em, and Mrs. Peabody runs when she sees any
one coming. She hasn't got a decent dress; so I
don't blame her much. Here, you sit down and
I'll call them."</p>

<p>Betty sat down on a flat rock and Bob spread
out his salt on another. The sheep knew his voice
and came slowly toward him.</p>

<p>"Come on now, Betty, and let's have a whack
at that magazine, the one about out West," said
Bob at last.</p>

<p>The promised package of books and magazines
had arrived, and Betty had generously placed
them at the disposal of the household. Wapley
and Lieson had displayed a pathetic eagerness for
"pictures," and sat up after supper as long as the
light lasted, turning over the illustrated pages.
Betty doubted if they could read.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<small>BETTY DEFENDS HERSELF</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Apparently</span> Mr. Peabody had never taken
Betty's threat to ask her uncle to take her away
seriously, and her presence at the farm soon came
to be an accepted fact. Conditions did not improve,
but Betty developed a sturdy, wholesome
philosophy that helped her to make the best of
everything. Uncle Dick wrote seldom, but packages
from Philadelphia continued to come at intervals,
and always proved to be practical and
needful.</p>

<p>"Though as to that, he couldn't have the lawyer
send me anything that wouldn't be useful,"
said Betty to herself. "I never saw a place where
there was so much <i>nothing</i> as here at Bramble
Farm."</p>

<p>One morning when the pouring rain kept her
indoors, Betty was exploring the little used parlor.
Mrs. Peabody seldom entered the room
save to clean it and close it up, and Betty opened
a corner of the blind with something like trepidation.
A large shotgun over the mantel attracted
her attention at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't touch that thing&mdash;it's always kept loaded,"
said the voice of Lieson at the door.</p>

<p>Betty shivered and drew away from the shelf.
Lieson showed his tobacco-stained teeth in a
friendly grin.</p>

<p>"I was up attic getting my rubber boots," he
explained, "and I saw the mail wagon stop at the
box. Do you want I should go down and get the
mail?"</p>

<p>"Oh, would you?" Betty's tone was eager.
"Perhaps there is a letter from my uncle. That
would be so kind of you, Mr. Lieson, because
otherwise I may have to wait till it stops raining."</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Lieson awkwardly, and he went
stumping down the hall.</p>

<p>Wapley and Lieson were rough and untidy, but
Betty found herself liking them better and feeling
sorry for them as time went on. They worked
hard and were never thanked and had very little
pleasure after their day's work was over. Several
times now they had done little kindnesses for
Betty, and she had tried to show that she appreciated
their efforts.</p>

<p>Lieson came back from the mail box carrying a
square package, but no letter. Though Mr. Peabody
was presumably waiting in the barn for him
and fuming at his delay, the man showed such a
naive interest in the parcel that Betty could not
resist asking him to wait while she opened it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, it's a camera!" she exclaimed delightedly,
as she took out the square box. "I'll take
your picture, Mr. Lieson, as soon as the sun comes
out, to pay you for walking through all this rain
to get the mail for me."</p>

<p>"Say, would you?" Lieson showed more animation
than Betty had ever noticed in him. "Honest?
I got a lady friend, and she's always at me
to send her my picture. She sure would admire
to have one of me."</p>

<p>"All right, she hasn't long to wait," promised
Betty gaily. "Here are two rolls of film, and
luckily I know how to operate a camera. Mr.
Arnold had a good one and he taught me. The
first sunny day, remember, Mr. Lieson."</p>

<p>The rain continued all that day, and at night
when Betty went up to bed she heard it pattering
on the tin roof of the porch which was under her
window.</p>

<p>Betty had managed to make her room more
habitable, and, relieved of any fear of embarrassing
her hostess, had tacked netting at the two
windows and bought herself a lamp with a good
burner. She scrupulously paid Mr. Peabody for
the oil she used, and while he showed plainly that
he considered burning a light at night in summer
a wicked extravagance, he did not interfere.</p>

<p>"Now let me see," mused Betty. "Shall I answer
Mrs. Arnold's last letter or go to bed? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
guess I'll go to bed. I'll have all day to write
letters to-morrow."</p>

<p>She was brushing her hair when a noise in the
next room startled her. She knew that it was not
occupied, for, besides herself, the Peabodys were
the only ones who slept on the second floor. Bob
Henderson and the hired men were housed in the
attic. The Peabodys' bedroom was further down
the hall, on the other side of the house.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" Betty put her brush back on the
table and gave her head a shake. "I mustn't get
nervous. We're too far out in the country for
burglars; and, besides, what in the world would
they come here after?"</p>

<p>Mr. Peabody differed from the majority of his
neighbors in that he banked most of his funds.
Some said it was because, if he had been in the
habit of keeping money in the house, his help
would have murdered him cheerfully and taken
the cash as a reward. Be that as it may, it was
well known that Joseph Peabody seldom had actual
money in his pocket or in his tin strong box,
and now Betty was glad to recall this.</p>

<p>She had braided her hair and put out the light
and was just slipping into bed when she heard
the noise again. This time it sounded against the
wall. Betty stealthily crept out of bed and ran to
her door. There was no door key, but she shot
the bolt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's some protection," she murmured, hopping
into bed again. "If there are burglars in
the house, I suppose I've locked 'em out to scare
Mr. and Mrs. Peabody to death. But at any rate
they have each other, and I'm all alone."</p>

<p>Closing her eyes tight, Betty began to say her
prayers, but she fell asleep before she had
finished.</p>

<p>She woke in the dark to hear a noise directly
under her bed!</p>

<p>She sat up, her eyes trying to pierce the darkness,
wondering why she had not taken the precaution
of looking under the bed before she locked
herself into a room with a burglar.</p>

<p>"If I look now and see his legs, I'll faint away,
I know I shall," she thought, her teeth chattering,
though the night was warm. "I wish to goodness
Uncle Dick had sent me a revolver."</p>

<p>That reminded her of the shotgun downstairs.
With Betty to think was to act, and she sprang
noiselessly out of bed and ran to the door. Thank
goodness, the bolt slipped without squeaking.
Downstairs ran Betty and lifted the heavy shotgun
from its place over the mantel. She was no
longer afraid, and her eyes sparkled with excitement.
She was having a grand adventure. She
had shot a gun a few times under Mr. Arnold's
instructions and careful supervision when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
teaching his boys how to handle one, and she
thought she knew all about it.</p>

<p>She gained her room, breathless, for the gun
was heavy. At the threshold she stopped a moment
to listen. Yes, there was the noise again.
The burglar was unaware of her flight.</p>

<p>Unaware herself of the absurdity of her deductions,
Betty raised the heavy gun and pointed
it toward the bed. As well as she could tell, she
was aiming under the bed. She shut her eyes
tight and fired.</p>

<p>The gun kicked unmercifully, and Betty ejaculated
a loud "Ow!" which was lost in the babble
of sound that immediately followed the shot.
There was the sound of breaking glass under the
bed, a shrill scream from Mrs. Peabody, and the
thunderous bellow of Mr. Peabody demanding:
"What in Sam Hill are those varmints up to
now?" Evidently he attributed the racket to
Wapley and Lieson, who had been known to come
home late from Glenside.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they were all gathered at
Betty's door, Bob open-mouthed and speechless,
the two men sleepily curious, the Peabodys loudly
demanding to know what the matter was.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt, Betty?" asked Mrs. Peabody
anxiously. "Where did you get the gun, dear?
Did something frighten you?"</p>

<p>"It's a burglar!" declared Betty. "I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
him under the bed! But I got him, I know I
did!"</p>

<p>"Light the lamp and look under the bed, Bob,"
commanded Mr. Peabody harshly. "I don't believe
this burglar stuff, but the girl's shot off a
good charge of buckshot, no doubt of that. Find
out what she hit."</p>

<p>Bob lit the lamp and stooped down to look.
Then his lips twitched.</p>

<p>"Rat!" he announced briefly. "A big one."</p>

<p>"Haul him out," directed Lieson. "Let's have
a look at him."</p>

<p>Betty had shrunk inside the doorway when the
lamp was lit, conscious of her attire, and now she
managed to reach her dressing gown and fling it
around her.</p>

<p>"He's in too many pieces," said Bob doubtfully.
"Guess we'll have to get a dustpan and brush."</p>

<p>Mr. Peabody and the two men went grumbling
back to bed, Peabody taking the gun for safekeeping,
but Mrs. Peabody sent Bob down to the
kitchen for the articles he mentioned, declaring
that Betty should not have to finish the night in a
room with a dead rat.</p>

<p>"If there was another bed made up, I'd move
you into it," she said. "But I haven't an extra
place ready."</p>

<p>Betty had pinned up her hair and put on her
slippers before Bob came back, and had put her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
best pink crepe dressing gown around Mrs. Peabody,
who presented an incongruous vision so attired.
Bob looked at Betty in admiration. With
her tumbled dark hair and pink cheeks and blue
gown and slippers, the boy thought her the prettiest
thing he had ever seen.</p>

<p>"I didn't want to tell you&mdash;don't look," he
whispered, getting down on his knees to sweep
out the remains of the slaughtered rat, "but the
buckshot hit two olive bottles, and there's some
mess here under your bed. I guess the rat was
after the crackers."</p>

<p>Bob carried down the dead rat and mopped up
the brine from the olives and threw out the debris,
making several trips downstairs without a murmur.
Finally it was all cleaned up, and they could
go back to their rooms and finish the remainder
of the night in probable peace.</p>

<p>"If you hear a noise"&mdash;Bob could not resist
this parting shot&mdash;"run down and grab the dinner
bell. We'll hear it just as quick, and you
might shoot the potted ham full of bullets next
time."</p>

<p>Betty did not sleep well, and once she woke,
sure that she had heard loud talking and shouts.
She thought the noise came from the attic.</p>

<p>"Lieson had the nightmare after your shindy,"
announced Bob at the breakfast table. "He suddenly
began shouting and got me by the throat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
declaring that if I didn't pay him every cent I
owed him he'd kill me. Wapley had to come and
pull him away, or I don't know but he would
have choked the breath out of me."</p>

<p>"I had a bad dream," said Lieson sullenly.</p>

<p>The rain was still coming down and all the
good-nature of the day before had left Lieson.
He refused to answer a remark of Mr. Peabody's,
and was evidently in a bad humor.</p>

<p>"He and the old man had a run in before
breakfast," whispered Bob, pulling on his boots
preparatory to carrying out food to the pigs.
Betty stood at the window and they could talk
without being overheard. "It was something
about money. Well, Betty, are you going gunning
to-day?"</p>

<p>"You needn't tease me," replied Betty, laughing.
"I feel foolish enough, without being reminded
of last night. I think I'll go upstairs and
sew on buttons as a penance. There's nothing I
hate to do worse."</p>

<p>"Do it well then," suggested the irrepressible
Bob, slamming the door just in time to avoid the
glass of water Betty tossed after him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<small>FOLLOWING THE PRESCRIPTION</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sound of some one chopping wood caught
the alert ear of Bob Henderson as he came
whistling through the yard on his way to the tool
house. Some peculiar quality in the strokes seemed
to suggest something to him, and he turned aside
and made for the woodshed.</p>

<p>"For the love of Mike! Betty Gordon, what
do you call it you're doing now?" he inquired,
standing in the frame of the woodshed, at a respectful
distance from the energetic figure by the
wood block.</p>

<p>"Chopping wood!" snapped Betty, hacking a
dry rail viciously. "Did you think I was cutting
out paper dolls?"</p>

<p>"My dear child, that isn't the way to chop
wood," insisted Bob paternally. "Here, let me
show you. You'll ruin the axe, to say nothing of
chopping off your own right ear."</p>

<p>Betty brought the axe down on the rail with
unnecessary violence.</p>

<p>"Let me alone," she said ominously. "I'm
mad! This is Uncle Dick's prescription, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
can't see that it works. The more I chop, the
madder I get!"</p>

<p>Bob grinned, and then as a shout of "You,
Bob!" sounded from outside, his expression
changed.</p>

<p>"Wapley is waiting for nails to fix the fence
with," he said hurriedly. "I'll have to hurry.
But come on down to the cornfield, can't you,
Betty? We can talk there."</p>

<p>Bob ran off, and Betty regarded the axe resentfully.</p>

<p>"Seems to me he's hoed enough corn to reach
round the earth," she said aloud. "I wonder if
Bob ever gets mad? Well, I guess I will go down
and talk to him, though I did mean to weed the
garden for Mrs. Peabody. I can do that this
afternoon."</p>

<p>In spite of the absence of fresh eggs and milk
from her diet, the weeks at Bramble Farm had
benefited Betty. She was deeply tanned from
days spent in the sun, and while perceptibly thinner,
a close observer would have known that
she was hardy and strong. She was growing
taller, too.</p>

<p>"Mr. Peabody is so mean!" she scolded,
dropping down under a scrubby wild cherry tree
in the field where Bob was already hard at work
hoeing corn, having delivered the nails to Wapley.
"You know this is the first fair day we've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
had since those three rainy ones, and I promised
Mr. Lieson I'd take his picture. He wants it
for his girl. And Mr. Peabody wouldn't let him
go upstairs and put on his best clothes. Said it
was his time and that foolishness could wait till
after supper. You know I can't take a snapshot
after supper!"</p>

<p>Bob hoed a few minutes in silence.</p>

<p>"Try a little diplomacy, Betty," he finally advised.
"Sunday is the time to take Lieson in his
glad rags. He looks fierce all dressed up, I think;
it probably will break off the match if his girl is
marrying him for his beauty. But Lieson the way
he is now&mdash;in that soft shirt and without his hat&mdash;isn't
half bad. He's got a kind of wistful,
gentle face, for all he can jaw so terribly; have
you noticed it? Go down in the potato field and
take his picture while he's working and tell him
you'll take him dressed up Sunday and he can
have both pictures. He'll be so pleased, he'll
offer to let you hold a pig."</p>

<p>Betty made a little face. Lieson had already
done just that. Thinking that Betty, who made
such a fuss over the baby lambs, would be equally
delighted with the little pigs, Lieson had told her
to shut her eyes one day and hold out her hands;
into them he had dropped a squirming, slippery,
squealing baby pig and Bob had always declared
he could not tell which made the most noise&mdash;Betty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
when she opened her eyes, or the pig when
she dropped him. Lieson had been much disappointed.</p>

<p>"I'll go and get the camera now," said Betty,
jumping up, all traces of temper vanished. "I'll
put in the film that holds a dozen and just go
round taking everything. That will be fun!"</p>

<p>She went running up the field and Bob's eyes
followed her wistfully.</p>

<p>"She's a good kid," he said to himself.
"Trouble is, she's never been up against it before
and she doesn't always know how to take it. It
does make her so mad to see old Peabody walk
all over every one; but there's no sense in letting
her buck against him when you can turn her
thoughts in another direction. Gee, I'm sick of
this blamed corn!"</p>

<p>Bob went up and down the endless rows, and
Betty skipped about, "snapping" views of Bramble
Farm to her heart's content. Lieson was delighted
to learn that he might have two pictures
of himself, and though it seemed to him a waste
of time to be photographed in his work clothes,
still he admitted that even an "ordinary" picture
was preferable to none.</p>

<p>"My lady friend," he announced proudly, as
Betty clicked her bulb, "she like me anyway."</p>

<p>Wapley, while without the excuse of a "lady
friend," was nevertheless almost childishly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
pleased to pose for his photograph, and him, too,
Betty promised to take again on Sunday. Mrs.
Peabody, weeding in the large vegetable garden
that was her regular care, alone refused to be
taken.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she shrank down among the cabbages
and pulled her hideous sunbonnet further
over her eyes when Betty pressed her to reconsider
her refusal. "Child, don't ask me. When
I look at the picture of me taken in my wedding
dress and then see myself in the mirror mornings,
I wonder if I'm the same person. I wouldn't have
my picture taken for one hundred dollars!"</p>

<p>Betty used up one roll of films that morning,
but she decided to save the other roll for Sunday,
as she was not sure she could get another in
Glenside. She determined to take her pictures
over that afternoon and have them developed, for
she was as eager to see the results as Lieson and
Wapley. Bob, too, owned up to a desire to see
how he "turned out."</p>

<p>"It's a pretty hot day," ventured Mrs. Peabody
uncertainly, when Betty, at the dinner table,
announced her intention of walking to Glenside
that afternoon. "Maybe, dearie, if you wait till
after supper, some one will be driving over."</p>

<p>"Horses ain't going a step off this farm this
week," said Mr. Peabody impressively. "They're
working without shoes, as anybody with any interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
in the place would know. If some folks
haven't any more to do than gad around spending
good money, it's none of my affair; but I don't
aim to run a stage between here and Glenside for
their convenience."</p>

<p>Dinner was finished in silence after this speech,
and immediately after she had helped Mrs. Peabody
with the dishes, Betty went up to her room
to change her dress. She did not mind the walk;
indeed she had taken it several times before, and
knew that one side of the road would be comparatively
shady all the way.</p>

<p>Betty took an inexplicable whim to put on her
prettiest dress, a delicate pink linen with white
collars and cuffs that Mrs. Arnold had taught her
to embroider herself in French knots. She untied
the black velvet ribbon she usually wore on
her broad-brimmed hat and substituted a sash of
pink mull.</p>

<p>"You look too nice!" exclaimed Mrs. Peabody
when the girl came downstairs. "Don't you think
you should take an umbrella, though? Those
big white clouds mean a thunder storm."</p>

<p>Betty laughingly declined the umbrella, and,
promising Mrs. Peabody "something pretty,"
started off on her walk. Poor Mrs. Peabody,
though Betty was too inexperienced to realize it,
was beginning, very slowly it is true, but still
beginning, to break under the long strain of hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
work and unhappiness. Betty only knew that she
was pitifully pleased with the smallest gift from
the town stores.</p>

<p>"If I don't see a girl of my own age to speak
to pretty soon," declared Betty to herself, walking
swiftly up the lane, "I don't know what I shall
do! Bob is nice, but, goodness! he isn't interested
in lots of things I like. Crocheting, for instance.
I never was crazy about fancy work, but
now I'm kind of hungry for a crochet needle."</p>

<p>Half way to Glenside a farmer overtook her,
and after the pleasant country fashion offered her
a "lift." Betty accepted gladly. He lived, as
she discovered after a few minutes' conversation,
on the farm next to the Peabodys, and he had
heard about her and knew who she was.</p>

<p>"When you get time," he said kindly, when
she told him she was going to Glenside, "walk
through the town and out toward Linden. There's
quite a nursery out that way, and you'd like to
see the flowers. Folks come from the city to buy
their plants there."</p>

<p>At the nearest crossroads to Glenside he
turned, and Betty got out, thanking him heartily
for the ride. It was a matter of only a few moments
now to reach Glenside, and she found herself
in the town much sooner than she had counted
on. So when the drug-store clerk said he would
have her pictures developed and printed within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
an hour if she could wait, Betty determined to
wait instead of having them mailed to her. She
had a sundae and bought some chocolates for
Mrs. Peabody, and then remembered the farmer's
remark about the nursery.</p>

<p>"How far is it to the nursery they talk about?"
she said to the woman clerk who had weighed
out the candy.</p>

<p>"Baxter's? Oh, not more than three-quarters
of a mile," was the answer. "You go right up
Main Street an far as the sidewalk goes. When
it stops, keep right on, and pretty soon you'll see
a big sign of a watering-pot; that's it."</p>

<p>Betty followed these directions implicitly, and
she had reached the end of the town sidewalk
when she heard the distant mutter of thunder.</p>

<p>"I guess I can reach the nursery and be looking
at the flowers while it storms," she said to
herself.</p>

<p>Betty had no more fear of thunderstorms than
of a tame cat, but she mightily disliked the idea
of getting her hat wet. So she hurried conscientiously.</p>

<p>The sun went under a heavy cloud, and a
violent crash of thunder directly overhead stimulated
her into a run. There was not a house in
sight, and Betty began to wish she had turned
and gone back to the town. At least she could
have found shelter in a shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Splash! A huge drop of rain flattened in the
dust of the road. The tall trees on either side
began to sway in the slowly rising wind.</p>

<p>"I'll bet it will be a big storm, and I'll be
soaked!" gasped Betty. "Where is that plaguey
nursery!"</p>

<p>She began to run, and the drops came faster
and faster. Then, without warning, the long line
of swaying trees stopped, and a tidy white picket
fence began on the side of the road nearest Betty.
Back of the pickets was a well-kept green lawn;
and set in the center of a circle of glorious elm
trees was a comfortable white house with green
blinds and a wide porch. A woman and two girls
were hastily taking in a swing and a quantity of
sofa pillows to protect them from the storm.</p>

<p>"Come in, quick!" called the woman, as Betty
came in sight. "Hurry, before you're soaked.
Just lift the latch and the gate swings in."</p>

<p>"Just lift the latch." Betty thought she had
never heard a more cordial or welcome invitation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<small>WINNING NEW FRIENDS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> opened the gate and ran up the path.
The younger girl, who seemed about her own
age, put out a friendly hand and touched her
sleeve.</p>

<p>"Not wet a bit, Mother!" she announced
triumphantly. "And I don't believe her hat's
spotted, either!"</p>

<p>A jagged streak of lightning and another
thundering crash sent them all scurrying indoors.
The lady led the way into a pleasant room where
an open piano, books, and much gay cretonne-covered
wicker furniture gave an atmosphere at
once homelike and modern. Betty had craved the
sight of such a room since leaving Pineville and
her friends.</p>

<p>"Pull down the shades, Norma; and, Alice,
light the lamp," directed the mother of the two
girls.</p>

<p>The younger girl drew the shades and Alice,
who was evidently some years older than her sister,
lighted the pretty wicker lamp on the center
table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm so glad you reached our house before the
storm fairly broke," said their mother, smiling
at Betty. "In another second you would have
been drenched, and there isn't a house between
here and Baxter's nursery."</p>

<p>Betty explained that she had been on her way
to the nursery, and thinking that her kind hostess
should know her guest's name, gave it, and said
that she was staying at Bramble Farm.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we've heard of you," said the lady,
in some surprise. "I am Mrs. Guerin, and my
husband, Dr. Guerin, learns all the news, you
know, on his rounds among his patients. Mrs.
Keppler, I believe, was the one who told him
there was a girl visiting the Peabodys."</p>

<p>Betty wondered rather uncomfortably what
had been said about her and whether she was
regarded with pity because of the conditions endured
by any one who had the misfortune to be
a member of the Peabody household. The
Kepplers, she knew, were their nearest neighbors.</p>

<p>Norma and Alice each took a seat on the arms
of their mother's chair, and regarded the guest
curiously, but kindly.</p>

<p>"Do you like the country?" asked the younger
girl, feeling that something in the way of conversation
was expected of her.</p>

<p>Betty replied in the affirmative, adding that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
aside from lonesomeness now and then, she had
enjoyed the outdoor life immensely.</p>

<p>"But what do you do all day long?" persisted
Norma. "The Peabodys are so queer!"</p>

<p>"Norma!" reproved her mother and Alice in
one breath.</p>

<p>"Well they are!" muttered Norma. "Miss
Gordon isn't a relation of theirs, is she? So why
do I have to be polite?"</p>

<p>"I'm only twelve," said Betty, embarrassed by
the "Miss Gordon," and puzzled to know how to
avoid a discussion of the Peabodys. "No one
ever calls me 'Miss.' My Uncle Dick went to
school with Mrs. Peabody, and he thought it
would be pleasant for me to board with them
this summer."</p>

<p>"When you get lonesome for girls, come over
and see us," suggested Mrs. Guerin cordially.
"Come whenever you are in Glenside, anyway.
Norma hasn't many friends of her own age in
town, and she'll probably talk you deaf, dumb
and blind."</p>

<p>"I don't get over very often," said Betty,
thinking how fortunate Norma was to have such
a lovely, tactful mother, "because I usually have
to walk. But if your husband is a doctor, couldn't
he bring you over to call some afternoon? Doctors
are always on the road, I know."</p>

<p>A curious expression swept over Mrs. Guerin's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
face, inexplicable to Betty. She avoided a direct
answer to the invitation by sending the girls out
to the kitchen for lemonade and cakes and blowing
out the lamp and raising the shades herself.
The brief thunderstorm was about over, and the
sun soon shone brightly.</p>

<p>Alice wheeled the tea-wagon out on the porch,
and the four spent a merry half hour together.
Betty felt that she had made three real friends,
and the Guerins, for their part, were agreeably
delighted with the young girl who was so alone
in the world and who, while they knew she must
have a great deal that was unpleasant to contend
with, resolutely talked only of her happy times.</p>

<p>Betty had just risen to go when a runabout
stopped at the curb and a gray-haired man got
out and came up the path.</p>

<p>"There's father!" cried Norma, jumping up
to meet him. "Father, the Rutans telephoned
over an hour ago. I couldn't get you anywhere.
It was before the storm."</p>

<p>"Hal, this is Betty Gordon," said the doctor's
wife, drawing Betty forward. "She is the girl
staying with the Peabodys. Do you have to go
out directly?"</p>

<p>"Just want to get a few things, then I'm off,"
answered the doctor cheerily. "Miss Betty, if
you don't mind waiting while I stop in at the drug
store, I'm going half of your way and will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
glad to give you a lift. The roads will be muddy
after this rain."</p>

<p>Betty accepted the kind offer thankfully, and
Mrs. Guerin and the girls went down to the car
with her. They each kissed her good-bye, and
Mrs. Guerin's motherly touch as she tucked the
linen robe over Betty's knees brought thoughts of
another mother to the little pink-frocked figure
who waved a farewell as the car coughed its
sturdy way up the street.</p>

<p>At the drug store the doctor got his medicines
and Betty her pictures, which she paid for and
slipped into her bag without looking at. She
liked Doctor Guerin instinctively, and indeed he
was the type of physician whom patients immediately
trusted and in whom confidence was never
misplaced.</p>

<p>"You look like an outdoor girl," he told her
as he turned the car toward the open country.
"I don't believe you've had to take much in the
way of pills and powders, have you?"</p>

<p>Betty smiled and admitted that her personal
acquaintance with medicine was extremely limited.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Peabody has headaches all the time,"
she said anxiously. "I think she ought to see a
doctor. And one day last week she fainted, but
she insisted on getting supper."</p>

<p>Doctor Guerin bit his lip.</p>

<p>"Guess you'll have to be my ally," he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
mysteriously. "Mrs. Peabody was a patient of
mine, off and on, for several years&mdash;ever since
I've practiced in Glenside, in fact. But&mdash;well,
Mr. Peabody forbade my visits finally; said he
was paying out too much for drugs. I told him
that his wife had a serious trouble that might
prostrate her at any time, but he refused to listen.
Ordered me off the place one day when Mrs.
Guerin was in the car with me, and was so violent
he frightened her. That was some time ago."
The doctor shook his head reminiscently. "Mrs.
Peabody in the house was groaning with pain and
Mrs. Guerin was imploring me to back the car
before Peabody killed me. He was shouting like
a mad man, and it was Bedlam let loose for sure.</p>

<p>"I went, because there was nothing else to do,
but I managed to get word to the poor soul,
through that boy, Bob Henderson, that if she
ever had a bad attack and would send me word,
day or night, I'd come if I had to bring the constable
to lock that miser up out of the way first.
I suspect he is a coward as well as a bully, but
fighting him wouldn't better his wife's position
any; he would only take it out on her."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think he would," agreed Betty. "I
used to wonder how she stood him. But telling
her what I think of him doesn't help her, and
now I don't do that any more if I think in time."</p>

<p>"Well, you may be able to help her by sending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
me word if she is taken ill suddenly," said the
doctor. "I'm sure it is a comfort to her to have
you with her this summer. Now here's the
boundary line. Sorry I can not take you all the
way in, but it would only mean an unpleasant
row."</p>

<p>Instead of half way, the doctor had taken her
almost to the Peabody lane, and Betty jumped
down and thanked him heartily. She was glad to
have been saved the long muddy walk. She was
turning away when a thought struck her.</p>

<p>"How could I reach you if Mrs. Peabody were
ill?" she asked. "There's no 'phone at Bramble
Farm, you know."</p>

<p>"The Kepplers have one," was the reply, Doctor
Guerin cranking his car. "They'll be glad to
let you use it any time for any message you want
to send."</p>

<p>Betty found no one in the house when she
reached it, the men being still at work in the field
and Mrs. Peabody out in the chicken yard. Betty
took off her pretty frock and put on a blue and
white gingham and her white shoes. She was
determined not to allow herself to get what Mrs.
Peabody called "slack," and she scrupulously
dressed every afternoon, whether she went off the
farm or not.</p>

<p>The pictures, she discovered when she examined
them, were exceptionally good. Lieson, in particular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
had proved an excellent subject, and Betty
privately decided that he was more attractive in
his working clothes than he could ever hope to
be in the stiff black and white she knew he would
assume for Sunday. She took the prints and went
downstairs to await an opportunity to show them.</p>

<p>Bob Henderson was in the kitchen, doing something
to his hand. Betty experienced a sinking
sensation when she saw a blood-stained rag floating
in the basin of water on the table.</p>

<p>"Bob!" she gasped. "Did you hurt yourself?"</p>

<p>Bob glanced up, managing a smile, though he
was rather white around the mouth.</p>

<p>"I cut my finger," he said jerkily. "The blame
thing won't stop bleeding."</p>

<p>"I have peroxide upstairs!" Betty flew to get
the bottle.</p>

<p>It was a nasty cut, but she set her teeth and
washed it thoroughly with the antiseptic and warm
water before binding it up with the clean, soft
handkerchief she had brought back with her. Bob
had been clumsily trying to make a bandage with
his dark blue bandana handkerchief, all the lad
had.</p>

<p>"How did you do it?" asked Betty, as she tied
a neat knot and tucked the ends in out of sight.
"I'll fix you some more cloths to-night; you'll
have to wash that cut again in the morning."</p>

<p>Bob was putting away the basin and now he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
went off to get the pails of slop for the pigs.
Betty thought he had not heard her question, but
when Lieson came in for a drink of water and
saw the pictures he unconsciously set her right.
Lieson was greatly pleased with his picture, and
looked so long at the other prints that Betty
feared lest Mr. Peabody should come in and make
an accusation of wasted time.</p>

<p>"That's a good picture of Bob, too," commented
Lieson. "He cut his hand this afternoon
on the hoe. The old man come down where he
was hoeing corn, and just as he got there Bob
cut a stalk; you can't always help it. Peabody
flew into a rage and grabbed the hoe. Bob
thought he was going to strike him with it and he
put up his hand to save his head, and Peabody
brought the sharp edge of the hoe down so it
nicked his finger. Guess he won't be able to milk
to-night."</p>

<p>Betty stood in the doorway of the kitchen and
stared away into the serene green fields.</p>

<p>"It looks so peaceful," she thought wearily.
"And yet to live in such a place doesn't seem to
have the slightest effect on people's dispositions.
I wonder why?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<small>NURSE AND PATIENT</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the next Sunday came round the shrill
song of the locusts began early, foretelling a
hot day. The heat and the flies and the general
uninviting appearance of the breakfast table
irritated Betty more than usual, and only consideration
for Mrs. Peabody, who looked
wretchedly ill, kept her at the table through the
meal. Lieson and Mr. Peabody bickered incessantly,
and Wapley, who had taken cold,
coughed noisily.</p>

<p>"Guess I'll go over and see Doc Guerin an'
get him to give me something for this cold,"
Wapley mumbled, after a particularly violent
paroxysm. "Never knew folks had colds in summer,
but I got one for sure."</p>

<p>"You take some of that horse medicine out on
the barn shelf," advised Peabody. "The bottle's
half full, and I'll sell it to you for a quarter. The
doctor's stuff will cost you all of a dollar, and that
horse medicine will warm you up fine. That's all
you want, anyway, something to kind of heat up
your pipes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Betty hoped fervently that the man would not
follow this remarkable prescription, and it was
with actual relief that she saw him come downstairs
an hour later arrayed in his best clothes
ready to walk to town. She had her camera
ready and stood patiently in the sun for fifteen
minutes till she had taken the promised pictures.
Wapley was snapped alone and with Lieson, and
then a photograph of Lieson alone, and then it
was Bob's turn. That usually amiable youth was
inclined to be sulky, but finally yielded to persuasion.
Betty was anxious to send a full set of
pictures to her uncle, and while Bob's "Sunday
best" was exactly the same as his week-day attire,
still, as she pointed out, he could wear his pleasantest
expression for a "close up."</p>

<p>The cause for Bob's crossness was revealed
after Lieson and Wapley had started for Glenside.
His sore finger was swollen and gave him
considerable pain.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you go with them and see the
doctor?" scolded Betty. "Go now. I think the
cut should be opened, Bob."</p>

<p>"I'm not going," said Bob flatly. "Where'd I
get any money to pay him?"</p>

<p>"I have some&mdash;&mdash;" Betty was beginning, but
he cut her short with the curt announcement that
he was not going to let her do everything for
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then, go over and let Doctor Guerin
examine your finger and offer to work it out for
him in some way," urged Betty. "Don't be silly
about money, Bob; any doctor does his work first
and then asks about his pay. Won't you go?"</p>

<p>"No, I won't," retorted Bob ungraciously.
"I'm too dog-gone tired to walk that far, anyway.
Let's take books out to the orchard, and if you
have any crackers or anything, we won't come
back for dinner. I hate that hot kitchen!"</p>

<p>This was very unlike Bob, and Betty noticed
that his face was flushed and his eyes heavy. She
was sure he had fever, but she knew it was useless
to argue with him. So, like the sensible girl she
was, she tried to make him comfortable without
further consulting him. She had a new parcel of
magazines he had not seen, and without asking
Mrs. Peabody, she took a square rug from the
parlor for him to lie on and the pillow from her
bed. Mrs. Peabody she knew would not object
to the rug being used, but Mr. Peabody was shaving
in the kitchen, and if he heard the request
would instantly deny it.</p>

<p>On her last trip to the town Betty had bought
a dozen lemons and a package of soda fountain
straws, and when Bob complained of thirst, she
surprised him with a lemonade. Fortunately the
water from the spring in one of the meadows was
icy cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob's "Gee, that's good!" more than repaid her
for her trouble and the heat headache that
throbbed in her temples from her hurried journeys
down to the spring.</p>

<p>There was a faint breeze stirring fitfully in the
orchard, and it was shady. Betty read aloud to
Bob until he fell asleep. After he was unconscious,
she looked at him pityingly, noting the sore finger
held stiffly away from its fellows and the pathetic
droop of the boyish mouth.</p>

<p>"His mother would be so sorry!" she thought,
folding up a paper to serve as a fan and beginning
to fan him gently. "I wonder how he happened
to be born in the poorhouse. He has nice hands
and feet, well-proportioned, that is, and mother
always said that was a mark of good breeding.
Besides, I know from the way he speaks and acts
that he is different from these hired men."</p>

<p>Betty continued to fan till she saw Mrs. Peabody
come out of the kitchen and go to the woodshed.
Then she ran in to tell her that Bob would
probably sleep through dinner and that would be
one less for the noon meal. Sunday dinner was
never an elaborate affair in the Peabody household,
and Betty insisted on helping Mrs. Peabody
to-day, since she could not induce her to go away
from the kitchen and lie down. The men had
said they were going to stay in town till milking
time, and only Mr. and Mrs. Peabody and Betty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
sat down to the sorry repast at one o'clock. There
was little conversation, and Mr. Peabody was the
only one who made a pretense of eating what
was served.</p>

<p>"Now you go upstairs, and let me do the
dishes," said Betty to Mrs. Peabody, as her husband
put on his hat and went out at the conclusion
of the meal. "If you'll undress and go to
bed, I'll get supper and feed the chickens. You
look so fagged out."</p>

<p>"It's the heat," sighed Mrs. Peabody. "Land,
child, I've crawled through a sight of summers,
and won't give out awhile yet, I guess. You're
the one to watch out. Keep in out of the sun,
and don't run your feet off waiting on Bob. I'll
show you something, though, if you won't let on."</p>

<p>She beckoned Betty to one corner of the kitchen
where a fly-specked calendar hung.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Mrs. Peabody. "Nobody
knows what these pencil marks mean but me&mdash;I
made 'em. Now's the second week in July&mdash;there's
seventeen days of July left. Thirty-one
days in August. And most generally you can
count on the first week of September being hot&mdash;that
makes fifty-five days. Three meals a day to
get, or one hundred and sixty-five meals in all."</p>

<p>"Then what?" asked the hypnotized Betty.</p>

<p>"Oh, then it begins to get a little cooler," said
Mrs. Peabody listlessly. "I've counted this way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
for three summers now. Somehow it makes the
summer go faster if you can see the days marked
off and know so many meals are behind you."</p>

<p>Inexperienced as Betty was, it seemed infinitely
pathetic to her that any one should long for the
summer days to be over, and she realized dimly
that the loneliness and dullness of her hostess'
daily life must be beginning to prey on her mind.
She helped dry the dishes, went upstairs with Mrs.
Peabody and bathed her forehead with cologne
and closed the shutters of her room for her. Then,
hoping she might sleep for a few hours as she
resolutely refused to give up for the rest of the
day, Betty hurried to put on her thinnest white
frock and went back to the orchard. She found
her patient awake and decidedly feeling aggrieved.</p>

<p>"I've been awake for ages," he greeted her.
"Gee, isn't it hot! You look kind of pippin' too.
Do you know, I've been thinking about that riding
habit of yours, Betty. What are you going to do
with it?"</p>

<p>"Keep it till I go somewhere else where there'll
be a chance to learn to ride," answered Betty.
"Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I was just thinking," and Bob turned over
on his back to stare up through the branches.
"You'll get away from here sooner than I shall,
Betty. But, believe me, the first chance I get I'm
going to streak out. Peabody's got no claim on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
me, and I've worked out all the food and clothes
he's ever given me. The county won't care&mdash;they've
got more kids to look after now than they
can manage, and one missing won't create any
uproar. I'd like to try to walk from here to the
West. They say my mother had people out there
somewhere."</p>

<p>"Tell me about her," urged Betty impulsively.
"Do you remember her, Bob?"</p>

<p>"She died the night I was born," said Bob
quietly. "My father was killed in a railroad
wreck they figured out. You see my mother was
a little out of her head with grief and shock when
they found her walking along the road, singing to
herself. All she had was the clothes on her back
and a little black tin box with her marriage certificate
in it and some papers that no one rightly
could understand. They sent her to the alms-house,
and a month later I was born. The old
woman who nursed her said her mind was perfectly
clear the few hours she lived after that, and
she said that 'David,' my father, had been bringing
her East to a hospital when their train was
wrecked. She couldn't remember the date nor
tell how long before it had happened, and after
she died no one was interested enough to trace
things up. I was brought up in the baby ward
and went to school along with the others. Many
is the boy I've punched for calling me 'Pauper!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
And then, when I was ten, Peabody came over and
said he wanted a boy to help him on his farm; I
could go to school in the winters, and he'd see
that I had clothes and everything I needed. I've
never been to school a day since, and about all I
needed, according to him, was lickings. But if I
ever get away from here I mean to find out a few
things for myself."</p>

<p>Bob paused for breath. His fever made him
talkative, and Betty had never known him so
communicative.</p>

<p>"Where is the tin box?" she asked with interest.</p>

<p>"Buried, in the garden. I had sense enough to
do that the first night I came to Bramble Farm,
and I've never dared dig it up since. Afraid old
Peabody might catch me. It's safer to leave it
alone."</p>

<p>Presently Bob went off to sleep again and
Betty mused silently till he woke, hungry, and
then she gave him bouillon cubes dissolved in hot
water, for Mrs. Peabody was getting supper and
Bob refused to go to the table. The men came
back and did the milking, grumbling a little, but
on the whole willing to save Bob's finger. They
had a rough fondness for the lad.</p>

<p>When the heavy dew began to fall Betty had to
appeal to Leison to make Bob go into the house.
He declared fretfully that the attic was hot, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Betty knew it was like an oven, but it was out
of the question for him to lie in the damp grass.
She dressed his finger freshly for him, Mrs. Peabody
looking on, but offering not a word, either
of pity or curiosity. Betty wondered if she had
grown into the habit of keeping still till now it
was impossible for her to voice an emotion.</p>

<p>Bob's finger dressed, Lieson bore him upstairs
despite his protests, and before the others went
up to their rooms, Betty had the satisfaction of
hearing that Bob had already gone to sleep.</p>

<p>Betty herself was extremely tired, for she had
worked hard all day, waiting on Bob and trying
to save Mrs. Peabody in many ways. She brushed
out her thick hair and slipped into her nightgown,
thankful for the prospect of rest even the hardest
of beds offered her. She was asleep almost as
soon as her head touched the pillow.</p>

<p>She had been asleep only a few minutes, or so
it seemed, when something woke her.</p>

<p>She sat up in bed, startled. Had some one
groaned?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<small>A MIDNIGHT CALL</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Betty's</span> first thought was of Bob. Was he
really sick? Then she remembered that the boy
slept in the attic and that she probably could not
have heard him if he had made the noise that
woke her.</p>

<p>Then the sound began again, deep guttural
groans that sent a shudder through the girl listening
in the dark, and Betty knew that Mrs. Peabody
must be ill. She lit her lamp and looked at
her watch. Half-past one! She had been asleep
several hours. Slipping on her dressing gown and
slippers, Betty opened her door, intending to go
down the hall to the Peabodys' room and see what
she could do. To her relief, she saw Mr. Peabody,
fully dressed except for his shoes, which
he carried in his hand, coming shuffling down the
hall.</p>

<p>"You're going for the doctor?" said Betty
eagerly. "Is Mrs. Peabody very ill? Shall I go
down and heat some water?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how sick she is," answered the
man sourly. "But I do know I ain't going for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
that miserable, no-account doctor I ordered off
this farm once. If you're going to die, you're going
to die, is the way I look at it, and all the
groaning in the world ain't going to help you.
And a doctor to kill you off quicker ain't necessary,
either. I'm going out to the barn to get a
little sleep. Here I've got a heavy day's work on
to-morrow, and she's been carrying on like this
for the better part of an hour."</p>

<p>Betty stared at Mr. Peabody in horror. Something
very like loathing, and an amazement not
unmixed with terror, seized her. It was inconceivable
that any one should talk as he did.</p>

<p>"She must have a doctor!" she flung at him.
"Send Bob&mdash;or one of the men, Bob's half sick
himself. If you won't call them, I will. I won't
stay here and let any one suffer like that. Listen!
Oh, listen!"</p>

<p>Betty put her hands over her ears, as a shrill
scream of pain came from Mrs. Peabody's room.</p>

<p>"Send the men on a wild goose chase at this
time of night?" snarled Mr. Peabody. "Not if
I know it. Morning will do just as well if she's
really sick. You will, will you?" He lunged
heavily before Betty, divining her intention to
reach the stairway that led to the attic. A heavy
door stood open for the freer circulation of air,
and this Peabody slammed and locked, dropping
the key triumphantly in his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"You take my advice and go back to bed," he
said. "One woman raising Cain at a time's
enough. Go to bed and keep still before I make
you."</p>

<p>Betty scarcely heard the implied threat. She
heard little but the heart-breaking groans that
seemed to fill the whole house. Her mind was
made up.</p>

<p>"I'm going myself!" she blazed, wrapping her
gown about her. "Don't you dare stop me!
You've killed your wife, but at least the neighbors
are going to know about it. I'm going to telephone
to Doctor Guerin!"</p>

<p>With a quick breath Betty blew out the lamp,
which bewildered Peabody for a moment. She
dashed past him as he fumbled and mumbled in
the dark and slid down the banisters and jerked
open the front door, which luckily for her was
seldom locked at night. She ran down the steps,
across the yard and into the field, her heart
pounding like a trip hammer. On and on she ran,
not daring to stop to look behind her. When she
heard steps gaining on her, her feet dragged with
despair, but her spirit flogged her on.</p>

<p>"I won't give up, I won't give up!" she was crying
aloud through clenched teeth when the voice
of Bob Henderson calling, "Betty! Betty! it's all
right!" sounded close to her shoulder.</p>

<p>"You dear, darling Bob!" Betty turned radiantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to face the boy. "How did you get out?
Hurry! We must hurry! Mrs. Peabody is so
sick!"</p>

<p>"Easy there!" Bob caught her elbow as she
stumbled over a bit of rough ground. "The noise
woke me up, and when we heard you and Peabody,
Lieson lowered me out of the window by
the bedsheet. We weren't sure what he'd do to
you. Say, Betty, you'd better let me go in and
telephone unless you're afraid to go back. If the
Kepplers see you like that, they'll know there's
been a row, and they'll insist on your staying with
them."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have to go back," said Betty in a panic.
"Mrs. Peabody needs me. And I'm not afraid,
if Doctor Guerin comes. I'll wait under this tree
for you, Bob. Only please hurry." And the boy
hurried off.</p>

<p>"Doctor'll be right out," reported Bob, coming
back after what seemed a long wait but was in
reality a scant ten minutes. "I had a great time
waking the Kepplers up and a worse time getting
hold of Central. And of course Mrs. Keppler
wanted all the details&mdash;just like a woman. But
doc answered right away after I gave his number
and said he'd be here in twenty minutes. He sure
can run his car when he has a clear road at
night."</p>

<p>"Bob," whispered Betty, beginning to tremble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
"I&mdash;I guess maybe I am afraid to go back to the
house. Let's sit on the bank at the head of the
lane and wait for Doctor Guerin. He'll take us
in the car. Mr. Peabody won't dare do anything
with a third person around."</p>

<p>"Sure we will," agreed Bob. "It's fine and cool
out here, isn't it? Wonder why it can't be like
this in the daytime."</p>

<p>They walked back to the lane, cross-lots, and
sat down under a thorn-apple tree. Betty tucked
her gown cosily around her feet and sat close to
Bob, prepared to watch the stars and await quietly
the doctor's coming. Then, to her astonishment
as much as to Bob's consternation, she began to
cry. She could not stop crying. And after she
had cried a few minutes she began to laugh. She
laughed and sobbed and could not stop herself,
and in short, for the first time in her life, Betty
had a case of hysterics.</p>

<p>It was all very foolish, of course, and when
Doctor Guerin found them there in the road at
half-past two in the morning, he scolded them
both soundly.</p>

<p>"I gave you credit for more sense, Bob," said
the doctor curtly, as he helped Betty into the machine.
"You should have left Betty with Mrs.
Keppler over night, or at least taken her straight
home. If she hasn't a heavy cold to pay for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
it won't be your fault. I never heard of anything
quite so senseless!"</p>

<p>"I wasn't going to stay with the Kepplers!" retorted
Betty with vigor. "I don't know them at
all, and I hadn't anything to wear down to breakfast!
'Sides there is Mrs. Peabody dreadfully sick
with no one to help her and Bob has a festered
finger. He had a high temperature this afternoon."</p>

<p>"I'll look at the finger," promised Doctor
Guerin grimly. "Don't let me have to hunt for
you, either, young man; no hiding out of sight
when you're wanted. And, Betty, you go to bed.
I'll get Mrs. Peabody comfortable and give her
something so that she'll sleep till I can send some
one out from town. You can't nurse her and run
the house, you know. Your Uncle Dick would
come up and shoot us all. Go to bed immediately,
and you'll be ready to help us in the morning."</p>

<p>They had reached the house and Betty followed
the doctor's orders. Every one obeyed Doctor
Guerin. Even Mr. Peabody, summoned from the
barn, though he was surly and far from pleasant,
brought hot water and a teaspoon and a tumbler
at his bidding. Mrs. Peabody had had these attacks
before, and when she had taken the medicine
was soon relieved. Doctor Guerin stayed with
her till she fell asleep and then went down to the
kitchen, taking the unwilling Bob with him. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
cut finger was lanced and dressed and strict instructions
issued that in two days Bob was to present
himself at the doctor's office to have the
dressing changed.</p>

<p>"And you needn't assume that obstinate look,"
said the doctor, who watched him closely. "If
you're so afraid you won't be able to pay me, we'll
drive a bargain. You recollect that odd little
wooden charm you made for Norma last summer?
Well, the girls at boarding school have
'gone crazy,' to quote my daughter, over the
trinket, and one of them offered her a dollar for
it. Carve me a couple more, when you have time,
and that will make us square. The girls were
wondering the other day if you could do more."</p>

<p>"I'll make six&mdash;&mdash;" Bob was beginning radiantly,
when the doctor stopped him.</p>

<p>"You will not," he said positively. "One dollar
is your price, and two of them will fully meet
your obligations to me. If you can be dog-gone
businesslike, so can I."</p>

<p>Doctor Guerin drove over again in the morning,
bringing a tall raw-boned red-haired Irish-woman
who looked as though she were able to
protect herself from any insult or injury, real or
fancied. Wapley and Lieson were pitiably in
awe of her, and Mr. Peabody simply shriveled before
her belligerent eye. She was to stay, said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the doctor, for a week at least and as much longer
as Mrs. Peabody needed her.</p>

<p>"Did you see her spreading the butter on her
bread?" demanded Bob in a whisper, meeting
Betty on the kitchen doorstep after the first dinner
Mrs. O'Hara had prepared.</p>

<p>"Did you see Mr. Peabody?" returned Betty, in
a twitter of delight. "I was afraid to look at
him, or I should have laughed. She tells me to
'run off, child, and play; young things should be
outdoors all day,' and she does a barrel of work.
Mrs. Peabody declares she is living like a queen,
with her meals served up to her. Poor soul, she
doesn't know what it means to have some one
wait on her."</p>

<p>Bob dared not stay away from Doctor Guerin's
office; and indeed, after receiving the order for
the wooden charms, he was willing to go. It was
understood that he was to begin his carving as
soon as the finger had healed, and Betty was interested
in the little trinket he brought back with
him to serve as a guide.</p>

<p>"Did you really make that, Bob?" she cried in
surprise. "Why, it's beautiful&mdash;such an odd shape
and so beautifully stained. You must be ever so
clever with your fingers. I believe, if you had
some paints, you could paint designs and perhaps
sell a lot of them to a city shop. Girls would just
love to have them to wear on chains and cords."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob was immediately fired with ambition to
make some money, and indeed he could evolve
marvelous and quaint little charms with no more
elaborate tools than an old knife and a bit of
sandpaper. He had an instinctive knowledge of
the different grains, and the wood he picked up
in the woodshed, carefully selecting smooth satiny
bits.</p>

<p>So all unknown to the Peabodys, Bob in his
leisure time began to carve curious treasures, and
with his carving to dream boyish dreams that
lifted him out of the dreary present and carried
him far away from Bramble Farm to big cities
and open prairies, to freedom and opportunity.</p>

<p>And Betty, who sometimes read aloud to him
as he carved and sometimes sewed, sitting beside
him, began to dream dreams too. Always of a
home somewhere with Uncle Dick, a real home in
which there should be a fireplace and an extra
chair for Bob. For your girl dreamer always
plans for her friends and for their happiness, and
she seldom dreams for herself alone.</p>

<p>So July with its heat and thunderstorms ran
into August.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<small>AN OMINOUS QUARREL</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. O'Hara</span> went back to Glenside at the
end of ten days, leaving Mrs. Peabody well
enough to be about, though the doctor had
cautioned her repeatedly not to overdo. Doctor
Guerin came for Mrs. O'Hara in his car, and it
was to be his last visit unless he was sent for
again. Bob's finger had healed, and he was hard
at work at his carving in spare moments.</p>

<p>"Norma hopes you will come over to see her
soon," said Doctor Guerin to Betty, as he was
leaving. "She and Alice have their heads full of
boarding school. By the way, Betty, what do you
intend to do about school?"</p>

<p>"Well, I keep hoping Uncle Dick will write.
It's been three weeks since I've had any kind of
letter," answered Betty. She had long ago told
the doctor about her uncle and the reasons that
led to her coming to Bramble Farm. "When he
wrote he was in a town where there were only six
houses and no hotel. He must come East soon,
and then he will receive my letters and send for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
me. I'm sure I could go to school and keep house
for him, too."</p>

<p>The car with the doctor and his convincing personality
and Mrs. O'Hara and her quick tongue
and heavy hand were hardly out of sight, before
Mr. Peabody assumed command of his household.
He had been chafing under the rule of that "red-haired
female," as he designated the capable Irish-woman,
and now he was bound to make the most
of his restored power.</p>

<p>"Gee, he sure is a driver," whispered the perspiring
Bob, as Betty came down to the field where
the boy was cultivating corn. Betty had brought
a pail of water and a dipper, and Bob drank
gratefully.</p>

<p>"No, don't give the horse any," he interposed,
as Betty seemed about to hold the pail out to the
sorrel who looked around with patient, pleading
eyes. "He'll have to wait till noon. 'Tisn't good
to water a horse when he's working, anyway. Put
the pail under that tree and it'll keep cool. Lieson
and Wapley go over to the spring when they're
thirsty, but Peabody said he'd whale me if he
caught me leaving the cultivator."</p>

<p>"The mean old thing!" Betty could hardly find
a word to express her indignation.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all in the day's work," returned Bob
philosophically. "What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Hanging out clothes for Mrs. Peabody.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
She's getting another basketful ready now. She
would wash, and that's as much as she'll let me do
to help her, though of course when she irons I
can be useful. I don't think she ought to get up
and go to washing, but you can't stop her."</p>

<p>"Having a woman come to wash about killed
the old man," chuckled Bob, starting the horse as
he saw Mr. Peabody climbing stiffly over the
fence. "Thanks for the water, Betty."</p>

<p>Betty had no wish to meet her host, for whom
another check had come that morning from her
uncle's lawyer. Betty herself was out of money,
Uncle Dick having sent no letter for three weeks
and apparently having made no provision to
bridge the gap.</p>

<p>She hung out clothes till dinner time, and then
helped put the boiled dinner on the table in the
hot, steamy kitchen. Wapley and Lieson ate in
silence, and Bob found a chance to whisper to
Betty that he thought there was "something doing"
between them and their employer.</p>

<p>Whatever this something was, there were no
further developments till after supper. Peabody
got up from the table and lurched out to the
kitchen porch to sit on the top step, as was his
invariable custom. He was too mean, his men
said, to smoke a pipe, though he did chew tobacco.
Bob had already taken the milk pails and gone to
the barn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>As Mrs. Peabody and Betty finished the dishes,
Wapley and Lieson came downstairs, dressed in
their good clothes, and went out on the porch
where Mr. Peabody sat silently.</p>

<p>"Can you let me have a couple of dollars to-night?"
asked Lieson civilly. "Jim and me's going
over to town for a few hours."</p>

<p>"You'll get no money from me," was the surly
answer. "Fooling away your time and money
Saturday night ought to be enough, without using
the middle of the week for such extravagance.
Anyway, you know well enough I never pay out in
advance."</p>

<p>There was an angry murmur from Wapley.</p>

<p>"Who's asking you for money in advance?" he
snarled. "Lieson and me's both got money coming
to us, and you know it. You pay us right up
to the jot to-night or we quit!"</p>

<p>Peabody was quite unmoved. He stood up,
leaning against a porch post, his hands in his
pockets.</p>

<p>"You can quit, and good riddance to you," he
drawled. "But you won't get a cent out of me.
You overdrew, both of you, last Saturday, and
there's nothing coming to you till a week from
this Saturday."</p>

<p>The men were a little confused, neither accustomed
to reckoning without the aid of pencil and
paper, but Wapley held doggedly to his argument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"We quit anyway," he announced with more
dignity than Betty thought he possessed. She and
Mrs. Peabody were listening nervously at the
window, both afraid of what the quarrel might
lead to. "You go pack our suitcases, Lieson, and
I will figure up what he owes us. Never again
do we work for a man who cheats."</p>

<p>Peabody leaned up against his post and chewed
tobacco reflectively, while Wapley, tongue in
cheek, struggled with a stub of pencil and a bit
of brown wrapping paper.</p>

<p>"There's twenty-five dollars coming to us," he
announced. "Twelve and a half apiece. Pay
us, and we go."</p>

<p>"I don't know about the going, but I know
there won't be any paying done," sneered Peabody,
just as Lieson with the two heavy suitcases
staggered through the door and Bob with his two
foaming pails of milk came up the steps.</p>

<p>Bob put down the milk pails to listen, and Wapley
took a step toward Mr. Peabody, his face
working convulsively.</p>

<p>"You cheater!" he gasped. "You miserable
sneak! You've held back money all season, just
to keep us working through harvest. If I had a
gun I'd shoot you!"</p>

<p>The man was in a terrible rage, and Betty wondered
how Mr. Peabody could face him so calmly.
Suddenly she saw something glitter in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've got my pistol right here," he said, raising
his hand to wave the blunt-nosed revolver toward
Wapley. "I'll give you two just three minutes to
get off this place. Go on&mdash;I said go!"</p>

<p>Wapley whirled about and saw the milk pails.
He seized one in either hand, raised them high
above his head and dashed the contents furiously
over Bob, Mr. Peabody, the steps and the porch
impartially, sprinkling himself and Lieson liberally,
too.</p>

<p>"I never knew how much milk those cows gave,"
Bob said later. "Seems like there must have been
a regular ocean let loose."</p>

<p>Mr. Peabody was furious and very likely would
have fired, but Bob put out his foot and tripped
him, though he managed to pass the matter off as
an accident. Wapley and Lieson trudged slowly
up the lane, carrying the heavy cheap leather suitcases.
Betty watched them as far as she could
see them, feeling inexpressibly sorry for the two
who had worked through the long hot summer
and were now leaving an unpleasant place with
what she feared was only a too well-founded
grievance.</p>

<p>"Some of you women," Peabody included Betty
in the magnificent gesture, "get to work out there
and clean up the milk. There's several pounds of
butter lost, thanks to those no-'count fools. I'm
going after my gun."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gun?" faltered Mrs. Peabody.</p>

<p>"Yes, gun," snapped her husband. "I don't
suppose it occurs to you those idiots may take it
into their heads to come back and burn the barns?
Bob and me will sit up all night and try to save
the cattle, at least."</p>

<p>Bob was furious at the idea of playing lookout
all night, and he was in the frame of mind by
early morning where he probably would have
cheerfully supplied any arson-plotters with the
necessary match. But nothing happened, and very
cross and sleepy, he and Mr. Peabody came in to
breakfast as usual.</p>

<p>Betty, too, had not slept well, having wakened
and pattered to the window many times to see if
the barns were blazing. Indeed, if Lieson and
Wapley had deliberately planned to upset the Peabody
family, they could not have succeeded better.</p>

<p>Bob made up his lost sleep the next night, but
his appetite came in for Mr. Peabody's criticism.</p>

<p>"You seem to be aiming to eat me out of house
and home," he observed at dinner a day or two
later. "You don't have to eat everything in
sight, you know. There'll be another meal later."</p>

<p>Bob blushed violently, not because of the reproof,
for he was used to that, but because of
the public disgrace. Betty, the cause of his distress,
was as uncomfortable as he, and she experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
an un-Christianlike impulse to throw
the dish of beans at the head of her host.</p>

<p>The following day Bob did not come in to dinner,
and Betty, thinking perhaps that he had not
heard Mrs. Peabody call, rose from the table with
the intention of calling him a second time.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" demanded Mr. Peabody
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"To call Bob to dinner," said Betty. "I'm
afraid he didn't hear Mrs. Peabody. The meat
will be all cold."</p>

<p>"You sit down, and don't take things on yourself
that are none of your concern," commanded
Mr. Peabody shortly. "Bob isn't here for dinner,
because I told him not to come. He's getting too
big to thrash, and the only way to bring him to
terms is to cut down his food. Living too high
makes him difficult to handle. This morning he
flatly disobeyed me, but I guess he'll learn not to
do that again. Well, Miss, don't swallow your
impudence. Out with it!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<small>IN THE NAME OF DISCIPLINE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> opened her mouth to speak hotly, then
closed it again. Argument was useless, and the
distressed expression on Mrs. Peabody's face reminded
the girl that it takes two to make a
quarrel.</p>

<p>Dinner was finished in silence, and as soon as
he had finished Mr. Peabody strode off to the
barn.</p>

<p>A plan that had been forming in Betty's mind
took concrete form, and as she helped clear the
table she did not carry all the food down cellar
to the swinging shelf, but made several trips to
one of the window sills. Then, after the last
dish was wiped and Mrs. Peabody had gone upstairs
to lie down, for her strength was markedly
slow in returning, Betty slipped out to the cellar
window, reached in and got her plate, and, carefully
assuring herself that Mr. Peabody was
nowhere in sight, flew down the road to where
she knew Bob was trimming underbrush.</p>

<p>"Gee, but you're a good little pal, Betty," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the boy gratefully, as she came up to him. "I'm
about starved to death, that's a fact."</p>

<p>"There isn't much there&mdash;just bread and potatoes
and some corn," said Betty hurriedly. "Eat
it quick, Bob. I didn't dare touch the meat, because
it would be noticed at supper. Seems to
me we have less to eat than ever."</p>

<p>"Can't you see it's because Wapley and Lieson
are gone?" demanded Bob, his mouth full. "We're
lucky to get anything at all to eat. Your cupboard
all bare?"</p>

<p>"Haven't a single can of anything, nor one box
of crackers," Betty announced dolefully. "The
worst of it is, I haven't a cent of money. What
can be the reason Uncle Dick doesn't write?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll hear before very long. Jumping
around the way he does, he can't write a letter
every day," returned Bob absently.</p>

<p>He handed back the plate to Betty and picked
up his scythe.</p>

<p>"Don't let old Peabody catch you with that
plate," he warned her. "He's got a fierce grouch
on to-day, because the road commissioners notified
him to get this trimming done. He's so mean he
hates to take any time off the farm to do road
work."</p>

<p>Betty went happily back to the house, forgetting
to be cautious in her satisfaction of getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
food to Bob, and at the kitchen door she walked
plump into Mr. Peabody.</p>

<p>"So that's what you've been up to!" he remarked
unpleasantly. "Sneaking food out to that
no-'count, lazy boy! I'll teach you to be so free
with what isn't yours and to upset my discipline.
Set that plate on the table!"</p>

<p>Betty obeyed, rather frightened.</p>

<p>"Now you come along with me." And, grasping
her arm by the elbow, Mr. Peabody marched
her upstairs to her own room very much as though
she were a rebellious prisoner he had captured.</p>

<p>"Sit down in that chair, and don't let me hear
a word out of you," said the farmer, pushing her
none too gently into the single chair the room contained.</p>

<p>From his pocket he drew a handful of nails,
and, using the door weight as a hammer, he proceeded
deliberately to nail up the window that
opened on to the porch roof.</p>

<p>"Now there'll be no running away," he commented
grimly, when he had finished. "Give kids
what's coming to 'em, and they flare up and try
to wriggle out of it. You'll stay right here and
do a little thinking till I'm ready to tell you different.
It's time you learned who's running this
house."</p>

<p>He went out, and Betty heard him turn a key
in the lock as he closed the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"So he's carried a key all the time!" cried the
girl furiously. "I thought there wasn't any for
that door! And the idea of speaking to me as he
did&mdash;the miserable old curmudgeon!"</p>

<p>She supposed she would have to stay locked in
till it suited Mr. Peabody to release her, and quite
likely she would have nothing to eat. If he could
punish Bob in that fashion, there was no reason
to think he intended to be any more lenient with
her.</p>

<p>"Even bread and water would be better than
nothing at all," said Betty aloud.</p>

<p>The sound of wheels attracted her attention,
and she peered through the window to see Mr.
Peabody in conversation with a stranger who had
driven in with a horse and buggy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peabody was stirring, and presently Betty
heard her go downstairs, and a few minutes later
she came out into the yard ready to feed her
chickens.</p>

<p>"Don't let the hens out in the morning,"
ordered Mr. Peabody, meeting her directly under
Betty's open window. The girl knelt down to
listen, angry and resentful. "Ryerson was just
here, and I've sold the whole yard to him. I want
to try Wyandottes next. He'll be over about ten
in the morning, and it won't hurt to keep them in
the henhouses till then."</p>

<p>"Oh, Joseph!" Mrs. Peabody's voice was reproachful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
"I've just got those hens ready to be
good layers this fall. You don't know how I've
worked over 'em, and culled the best and sprayed
those dirty old houses and kept 'em clean and
disinfected. I don't want to try a new breed. I
want a little of the money these will earn this
winter."</p>

<p>"Well, this happens to be my farm and my livestock,"
replied her husband cruelly. "If I see a
chance to improve the strain, I'm going to take it.
You just do as I say, and don't let the hens out
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>His wife dragged herself out to the chicken
yard, her brief insistence having completely collapsed.
The girl listening wondered how any
woman could give in so easily to such palpable injustice.</p>

<p>"I suppose she doesn't care," thought Betty,
stumbling on the heart of the matter blindly. "If
she did have her own way, that wouldn't change
him; he'd still be mean and small and not very
honest and she'd have to despise him just as much
as ever. Things wouldn't make up to her for the
kind of man her husband is."</p>

<p>Supper time came and went, and the odor of
frying potatoes came up to Betty in delicious
whiffs, though she had been known to turn up her
little freckled nose when this dish was passed to
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>About eight o'clock Mr. Peabody unlocked the
door and set inside a plate of very dry bread and
a small pitcher of water, locking the door after
him. Betty slid the bolt angrily and this gave her
some satisfaction. She ate her bread and water
and listened for a while at the window, hoping to
hear Bob's whistle. But nothing disturbed the
velvety silence of the night, and by half-past nine
Betty was undressed and in bed, asleep.</p>

<p>She woke early, as usual, dressed and unbolted
her door, hungry enough to be humble. But no
bread and water arrived.</p>

<p>The rattle of milk pails and the sounds which
indicated that breakfast was in progress ceased
after a while and the house seemed unusually
quiet. Then, just as Betty decided to try tying
the bedclothes into a rope and lowering herself
from the window, she heard Bob's familiar
whistle.</p>

<p>"Hello, Princess Golden Hair!" Bob grinned
up at her from the old shelter of the lilac bush.
"Let down your hair, and I'll send you up some
breakfast."</p>

<p>This was an old joke with them, because
Betty's hair was dark, and while thick and smooth
was not especially long.</p>

<p>"I want you to help me get out of here!" hissed
Betty furiously. "I won't stay locked in here like
a naughty little child. Can't you get me a ladder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
or <i>something</i>, Bob, and not stand there like an
idiot?"</p>

<p>"Gee, you are hungry," said Bob with commiseration.
"Dangle me down a string, Princess,
and I'll send you up some bread with butter on it.
I helped myself to both. We can talk while you
eat."</p>

<p>Betty managed to find a strong, long string,
and she threw one end down to Bob, who tied the
packet to it; then Betty hauled it up and fell upon
the food ravenously.</p>

<p>"I got you into this pickle," said Bob regretfully.
"Old Peabody licked me for good measure
last night, or I would have been round at this
window trying to talk to you. Awfully sorry,
Betty. It must be hot, too, with that other window
nailed up."</p>

<p>"Do you mean he whipped you?" gasped Betty,
horrified. "Why? And what did you do yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yesterday I wouldn't back him up in a lie
he tried to tell the road commissioner," said Bob
cheerfully. "And last night I sassed him when
I heard what he'd done to you. So we had an
old-fashioned session in the woodshed. But that's
nothing for you to worry over."</p>

<p>"Where is he now?" asked Betty fearfully.</p>

<p>"Gone over to Kepplers to see about buying
more chickens," answered Bob. "Mrs. Peabody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
has gone to salt the sheep, and I'm supposed to
be cleaning harness in the barn."</p>

<p>"Get me a ladder&mdash;now's my time!" planned
Betty swiftly. "I could bob my hair and you
might lend me a pair of overalls, Bob. For I
simply won't come back here. It's too far to
jump to the ground, or I should have tried it.
Hurry up, and bring me a ladder."</p>

<p>"I'll get a ladder on one condition," announced
Bob stubbornly. "You must promise to go to
Doctor Guerin's. Not cutting your hair and wandering
around the country in boy's clothes.
Promise?"</p>

<p>Betty shook her head obstinately.</p>

<p>"All right, you stay where you are," decreed
Bob. "I have to go to Laurel Grove, anyway,
and I ought to be hitching up right now."</p>

<p>He turned away.</p>

<p>"All right, I promise," capitulated Betty,
"Hurry with the ladder before Mr. Peabody
comes back and catches us."</p>

<p>Bob ran to the barn and was back in a few
minutes with a long ladder.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<small>THE ESCAPE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> capered exultantly when she was on the
ground.</p>

<p>"I packed my things last night," she informed
Bob. "If Mr. Peabody isn't too mean, he'll keep
the trunk for me and send it when I write him to.
Here, I'll help you carry back the ladder."</p>

<p>"Take your sweater and hat," advised the practical
Bob, pointing to these articles lying on a
chair on the porch where Betty had left them the
afternoon before. "You don't want to travel too
light. I think we'll have a storm before noon."</p>

<p>Betty helped carry the ladder back to the barn
and put it in place. Then she hung around
watching Bob harness up the sorrel to the dilapidated
old wagon preparatory to driving to Laurel
Grove, a town to the east of Glenside.</p>

<p>"I'd kind of like to say good-bye to Mrs. Peabody,"
ventured Betty, trying to fix a buckle.</p>

<p>"Well, you can't. That would get us both in
trouble," returned Bob shortly. "There! you've
dawdled till here comes the old man. Scoot out
the side door and keep close to the hedge. If I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
overtake you before you get to the crossroads
I'll give you a lift. Doc Guerin will know what
you ought to do."</p>

<p>Her heart quaking, Betty scuttled for the narrow
side door and crept down the lane, keeping
close to the osage orange hedge that made a thick
screen for the fence. Evidently she was not seen,
for she reached the main road safely, hearing no
hue and cry behind her.</p>

<p>"So you haven't started?" Peabody greeted the
somewhat flustered Bob, entering the barn and
looking, for him, almost amiable. "Well, hitch
the horse, and go over to Kepplers. He wants
you to help him catch a crate of chickens. The
horse can wait and you can come home at twelve
and go to Laurel Grove after dinner."</p>

<p>Bob would have preferred to start on his errand
at once, so that he might be at a safe distance
when Betty's absence should be discovered;
but he hoped that Peabody might not go near her
room till afternoon, and he knew Mrs. Peabody
was too thoroughly cowed to try to communicate
with Betty, fond as she was of her.</p>

<p>"I'll take a chance," thought Bob. "Anyway,
the worst he can do to me is to kill me."</p>

<p>This not especially cheerful observation had
seen Bob through many a tight place in the past,
and now he tied the patient horse under a shady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
tree and went whistling over to the Keppler farm
to chase chickens for a hot morning's work.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bob!" To his amazement, Mrs. Peabody
came running to meet him when he came
back at noon to get his dinner. "Oh, Bob!"</p>

<p>Poor Bob felt a wobbling sensation in his
knees.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he asked shakily. "Yes, what is it?"</p>

<p>"The most awful thing has happened!" Mrs.
Peabody wiped the perspiration from her forehead
with her apron. "The most awful thing!
I never saw Joseph in such a temper, never! He
swore till I thought he'd shrivel up the grass!
And before Mr. Ryerson, too!"</p>

<p>Bob's face cleared.</p>

<p>"Did he try to cheat Ryerson?" he asked
eagerly. "That is, er&mdash;I mean did he think Ryerson
was trying to cheat him?"</p>

<p>"Cheat?" repeated Mrs. Peabody, sitting down
on an old tree stump to get her breath. "No
one said anything about cheating. I don't know
exactly how to tell you, Bob. Betty has gone and
she's taken all the chickens with her!"</p>

<p>Bob opened his eyes and mouth to their widest
extent. Chickens! Betty! The words danced
through his brain stupidly.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder you look like that," said Mrs.
Peabody. "I was in a daze myself."</p>

<p>"But she couldn't have taken the chickens!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
argued Bob, restraining a mad desire to laugh.
"How could she? And what would she want
with them?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course, I don't mean she took them
with her," admitted Mrs. Peabody. "But she
was mad at Joseph, you know, for locking her in
her room, and he says she's just driven the hens
off to the woods to spite him."</p>

<p>Bob walked out to the poultry yard, followed
by Mrs. Peabody. The doors of the henhouses
were flung wide open, and there was not a fowl
in sight.</p>

<p>"When did you find it out?" he asked.</p>

<p>"When Mr. Ryerson drove in for the hens,"
answered Mrs. Peabody. "Joseph went out with
him to help him bag 'em, and the minute he
opened the door he gave a yell. I was making
beds, but I heard him. The way he carried on,
Bob, was a perfect scandal. I never heard such
talk, never!"</p>

<p>"Where is he now?" said Bob briefly.</p>

<p>"He's gone over to the woods, hunting for the
hens," replied Mrs. Peabody. "He wouldn't stop
for dinner, or even to take the horse. He says
you're to start for Laurel Grove, soon as you've
eaten. He's going to search the woods and then
follow the Glenside road, looking for Betty."</p>

<p>Bob did not worry over the possibility of Betty
being overtaken by the angry farmer. He counted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
on her getting a lift to Glenside, since the road
was well traveled in the morning, and probably
she was at this very moment sitting down to lunch
with the doctor's family. He was puzzled about
the loss of the chickens, and curious to know how
the Peabodys had discovered Betty's escape.</p>

<p>He and Mrs. Peabody sat down to dinner, and,
partly because of her excitement and partly because
in her husband's absence she dared to be
more generous, Bob made an excellent meal.
Over his second piece of pie he ventured to ask
when they had found out that Betty was not in
her room.</p>

<p>"Oh, Joseph thought of her as soon as he
missed the chickens," answered Mrs. Peabody.
"I never thought she would be spiteful, but I declare
it's queer, anyway you look at it. Joseph
flew up to her room and unlocked the door, and
she wasn't there! Do you suppose she could have
jumped from the window and hurt herself?"</p>

<p>Bob thought it quite possible.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't," said Mrs. Peabody shrewdly.
"However, I'm not asking questions, so there's
no call for you to get all red. Joseph seemed to
think she had jumped out, and he's furious because
he didn't nail up both windows, though how
he expected Betty to breathe in that case is more
than I can see."</p>

<p>Bob was relieved to learn that apparently Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Peabody did not connect him with Betty's disappearance.
He finished his dinner and went out
to do the few noon chores. Then he started on
the drive to Laurel Grove.</p>

<p>"Looks like a storm," he muttered to himself,
as he noted the heavy white clouds piling up
toward the south. "I wish to goodness, old Peabody
would spend a few cents and get an awning
for the seat of this wagon. Last time I was
caught in a storm I got soaked, and my clothes
didn't dry overnight. I'll be hanged if I'm going
to get wet this time&mdash;I'll drive in somewhere
first."</p>

<p>Bob's predictions of a storm proved correct,
and before he had gone two miles he heard distant
thunder.</p>

<p>With the first splash of rain Bob hurried the
sorrel, keeping his eyes open for a mail-box that
would mark the home of some farmer where he
might drive into the barn and wait till the shower
was over.</p>

<p>He came within sight of some prosperous looking
red barns before the rain was heavy, and
drove into a narrow lane just as the first vivid
streak of lightning ripped a jagged rent in the
black clouds.</p>

<p>"Come right on in," called out the farmer, who
had seen him coming and thrown open the double
doors. "Looks like it might be a hummer, doesn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
it? There's a ring there in the wall where you
can tie your horse."</p>

<p>"He stands without hitching," grinned Bob.
"Only too glad to get the chance. Gee, that wind
feels good!"</p>

<p>The farmer brought out a couple of boxes and
turned them up to serve as seats.</p>

<p>"I like to watch a storm," he observed. "The
house is all locked up&mdash;women-folk gone to an
all-day session of the sewing circle&mdash;or I'd take
you in. We'd get soaked walking that short distance,
though. You don't live around here, do
you?"</p>

<p>"Bramble Farm. I'm a poorhouse rat the Peabodys
took to bring up."</p>

<p>He had seldom used that phrase since Betty's
coming, but it always irritated him to try to explain
who he was and where he came from.</p>

<p>"I was bound out myself," retorted the farmer
quickly. "Knocked around a good bit, but now
I own this ninety acres, free and clear. You've
got just as good a chance as the boy with too much
done for him. Don't you forget that, young
man."</p>

<p>They were silent for a few moments, watching
the play of lightning through the wide doors.</p>

<p>"Didn't two men named Wapley and Lieson
used to work for Peabody?" asked the farmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
abruptly. "I thought so," as Bob nodded. "They
were around the other day asking for jobs."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" asked Bob. "I thought they
had left the state. Lieson, I know, had folks
across the line."</p>

<p>"Well, they may have gone now," was the reply.
"But I know that two days ago they wanted
work. I've a couple of men, all I can use just
now, but I sent them on to a neighbor. They
looked strong, and good farm help is mighty
scarce."</p>

<p>Bob waited till the rain had stopped and the
clouds were lifting, then drove on, thanking the
friendly farmer for his cordiality.</p>

<p>"Don't be calling yourself names, but plan
what you want to make of yourself," was that
individual's parting advice.</p>

<p>"If I had a nickel," said Bob to himself, urging
the sorrel to a brisk trot, for the time spent in
waiting must be made up, "I'd telephone to Betty
from Laurel Grove. But pshaw! I know she
must be all right."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob</span> would not have dismissed his misgivings
so contentedly had he been able to see Betty just
at that moment.</p>

<p>When she shook the dust of Bramble Farm
from her feet, which she did literally at the
boundary line on the main road, to the great delight
of two curious robins and a puzzled chipmunk,
she said firmly that it was forever. As she
tramped along the road she kept looking back,
hoping to hear the rattle of wheels and to see Bob
and the sorrel coming after her. But she reached
the crossroads without being overtaken.</p>

<p>Years ago some thoughtful person had taken
the trouble to build a rude little seat around the
four sides of the guidepost where the road to
Laurel Grove and Glenside crossed, and in a nearby
field was a boarded-up spring of ice-cold water,
so that travelers, on foot and in motor-cars and
wagons, made it a point to rest for a few minutes
and refresh themselves there. Betty was a trifle
embarrassed to find a group of men loitering
about the guide-post when she came up to it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
They were all strangers to her, but with the ready
friendliness of the country, they nodded respectfully.</p>

<p>"Want to sit down a minute, Miss?" asked a
gray-haired man civilly, standing up to make room
for her. "Didn't expect to see so many idle
farmers about on a clear morning, did you?"</p>

<p>Betty shook her head, smiling.</p>

<p>"I won't sit down, thank you," she said in her
clear girlish voice. "I'll just get a drink of water
and go on; I want to reach Glenside before noon."</p>

<p>"Glenside road's closed," announced one of the
younger men, shortly.</p>

<p>"Closed!" echoed Betty. "Oh, no! I have to
get there, I tell you."</p>

<p>Her quick, frightened glance fell on the man
who had first spoken to her, and she appealed to
him.</p>

<p>"The road isn't closed, is it?" she asked breathlessly.
"That isn't why you're all here?"</p>

<p>"Now, now, there's nothing to worry your
head about," answered the gray-haired farmer
soothingly. "Jerry, here, is always a bit abrupt
with his tongue. As a matter of fact, the road is
closed; but if you don't mind a longer walk, you
can make a detour and get to Glenside easily
enough."</p>

<p>Betty gazed at him uncertainly.</p>

<p>"You see," he explained, "King Charles, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
prize bull at Greenfields, the big dairy farm, got
out this morning, and we suppose he is roaming
up and down between here and Glenside. He's
worth a mint of money, so they don't want to
shoot him, and the dairy has offered a good reward
for his safe return. He's got a famous
temper, and no one would deliberately set out to
meet him unarmed; so we're posted here to warn
folks. A few automobiles took a chance and
went on, but the horses and wagons and foot passengers
take the road to Laurel Grove. You
turn off to the left at the first road and follow
that and it brings you into Glenside at the north
end of town. You'll be all right."</p>

<p>"A girl shouldn't try to make it alone," objected
another one of the group. "You take my
advice, Sis, and wait till your father or brother
can take you over in the buggy. Suppose you
met a camp of Gypsies?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not afraid," Betty assured him.
"That is, not of people. But I don't know what
in the world I should do if I met an angry bull.
I'll take the detour, and everything will be all
right. I'm used to walking."</p>

<p>The men repeated the directions again, to make
sure she understood clearly. Then Betty drank a
cup of the fresh, cold spring water, and bravely
set off on the new road.</p>

<p>The gray-haired man came running after her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"If it should storm," he cried, coming up with
her, "don't run under a tree. Better stay out in
the rain till you reach a house. You'll be safe in
any farmhouse."</p>

<p>He meant safe as far as the kind of people she
would meet were concerned, but Betty, who had
never in her life feared any one, thought he referred
to protection from the elements. She
thanked him, and trudged on.</p>

<p>"I certainly am hungry," she said, after a half
hour of tramping. "Now I know how Bob feels
without a cent in his pocket. I'll have to ask
Doctor Guerin for some money. I can't get along
without a nickel. Uncle Dick must be awfully
busy, or else he's sick. Otherwise he would surely
let me hear from him."</p>

<p>When she came to an old apple orchard where
the trees drooped over a crumbling stone wall,
Betty had no scruples about filling the pockets
and sleeves of her sweater with the apples that
lay on the ground. Bob had told her that portions
of trees that grew over the roadside were
public property, and she intended to explain to
the farmer, if she met him, how she had come to
carry off some of his fruit. But she met no one
and saw no house, and presently the rumble of
distant thunder put all thoughts of apples out of
her mind.</p>

<p>"My goodness!" She looked at the mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of white clouds piling up with something like
panic. "I haven't even come to the road that
turns, and I just know this will be a hard thunderstorm.
Mrs. Peabody said last week that the
August storms are terrors. I'll run, and perhaps
I'll come to a house."</p>

<p>Holding her sweater stuffed with apples in her
arms, and jamming her hat firmly on her head,
Betty flew down the road, bouncing over stones,
jumping over, without a shudder, a mashed black-snake
flattened out in the road by some passing
car, and, in defiance of all speed regulations, refusing
to slow up at a sharp turn in the road
ahead. She took it at top speed, and as she
rounded the curve the first drops of rain splashed
her nose. But her flight was rewarded.</p>

<p>A long, low, comfortable-looking farmhouse
sat back in an overgrown garden on one side of
the road.</p>

<p>"D. Smith," read Betty on the mail box at the
gate. "Well, Mrs. D. Smith, I hope you're at
home, and I hope you'll ask me to come in and
rest till the storm's over. Shall I knock at the
back or the front door?"</p>

<p>A vivid flash of lightning sent her scurrying
across the road and up the garden path. As she
lifted the black iron knocker on the front door a
peal of thunder rattled the loose casements of the
windows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Betty lifted the knocker and let it fall three
times before she decided that either Mrs. D.
Smith did not welcome callers at the front of her
house, or else she could not hear the knocker from
where she was. But a prolonged rat-a-tat-tat on
the back door produced no further results.</p>

<p>"She may be out getting the poultry in," said
Betty to herself, recalling how hard Mrs. Peabody
worked every time a storm came up. "Wonder
where the poultry yard is?"</p>

<p>The rain was driving now, and the thunder irritatingly
incessant. Betty walked to the end of
the back porch and stood on her tiptoes trying
to see the outbuildings. Then, for the first time,
she noticed what she would surely have seen in
one glance at a less exciting time.</p>

<p>There were no outbuildings, only burned and
blackened holes in the ground! A few loose
bricks marked the site of masonry-work, and a
charred beam or two fallen across the gaps showed
only too plainly what had been the fate of barns
and crib houses.</p>

<p>Betty ran impulsively to a window, and, holding
up her hands to shut out the light, peered in.
Cobwebs, dust and dirt and a few empty tins in
the sink were the only furniture of the kitchen.</p>

<p>"It's empty!" gasped Betty. "No one lives
here! Oh, gracious!"</p>

<p>A great fork of lightning shot across the sky,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
followed at once by a deafening crash of thunder.
Far across the field, on the other side of
the road, Betty saw a tall oak split and fall.</p>

<p>"I'm going in out of this," she decided, "if I
have to break a window or a lock!"</p>

<p>She leaned her sturdy weight against the
wooden door, automatically turning the knob
without thought of result. The door swung easily
open&mdash;there had been nothing to hinder her walking
in&mdash;and she tumbled in so suddenly that she
had difficulty in keeping her feet.</p>

<p>Betty closed the door and looked about her.</p>

<p>The storm shut out, she immediately felt a
sense of security, though a hasty survey of the
three rooms on one side of the hall failed to reveal
any materials for a fire or a meal, two comforts
she was beginning to crave. She took an
apple from her sweater pocket, and, munching
that, set out to explore the rooms on the other
side of the hall.</p>

<p>A curious, yet familiar, noise drew her attention
to the front room, probably in happier days
the parlor of the farmhouse. Peering in through
the partly open folding doors, Betty saw seven
crates of chickens!</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;how funny!" She was puzzled.
"Where could they have come from? And what
are they doing here? Even if they saved them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
from the fire, they wouldn't be left after all the
furniture was moved out."</p>

<p>She went up to the crates and examined them
more closely.</p>

<p>"That black rooster is the living image of Mrs.
Peabody's," she thought, "And the White Leghorns
look like hers, too. But, then, I suppose
all chickens look alike. I never could see how
their hen mothers told them apart."</p>

<p>Still carrying her sweater with the apples, she
wandered upstairs, trying to people the vacant,
dusty rooms and wondering what had happened
to those who had dwelt here and where they had
gone.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the fire was at night and whether
they were terribly frightened," she mused. "I
should say they were mighty lucky to save the
house, though perhaps the barns are the most
necessary buildings on a farm. Why didn't they
build them up again, instead of moving out? I
would."</p>

<p>She was standing in one of the back rooms,
and from the window she could look down and
see what had once been the garden. The drenched
rosebushes still showed a late blossom or two, and
there was a faint outline of orderly paths and a
tangle of brilliant color where flowers, self-sown,
struggled to force their way through the choking
weeds. The drip, drip of the rain sounded dolefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
on the tin roof, and a cascade ran off at one
corner of the house showing where a leader was
broken. Toward the west the clouds were lifting,
though the thunder still grumbled angrily.</p>

<p>Betty went through the rather narrow hall and
entered a pleasant, prettily papered room where
a low white rocking chair and a pink sock on the
floor spoke mutely of the baby whose kingdom
had been bounded by the wide bay window.</p>

<p>"They forgot the rocker," said Betty, drawing
it up to the window and resting her elbows on the
narrow window ledge. "I hope he was a fat,
pretty baby," she went on, picking up the sock
and holding it in her hand. "Is that some one
coming down the road?"</p>

<p>It was&mdash;two people in fact; and as they drew
nearer Betty's eyes almost popped out with astonishment.
The pair talking together so earnestly,
completely oblivious of the rain, were Lieson and
Wapley, the two men who had worked for Mr
Peabody! And they were turning in at the path
guarded by the mail box inscribed "D. Smith."</p>

<p>Betty flew to the door of the room where she
sat and drew the bolt.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />
<small>THE CHICKEN THIEVES</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Over</span> in one corner of the bay-window room,
as Betty had already named it, was a black register
in the floor, designed to let the warm air from
a stove in the parlor below heat the bedroom
above. Toward this Betty crept cautiously, testing
each floor board for creaks before she trusted
her whole weight to it. She reached the register,
which was open, and was startled at the view it
opened up for her. She drew back hastily, afraid
that she would be discovered.</p>

<p>Lieson and Wapley stood almost squarely under
the register, above the crates of chickens and
looking down on the fowls.</p>

<p>"I began to think you wasn't coming," Lieson
said slowly, putting a hand on his companion's
shoulder to steady himself as he lurched and
swayed. "I got soaked to the skin waiting for
you in those bushes."</p>

<p>"Well, it's some jaunt to Laurel Grove," came
Wapley's response. "I got a man, though. Coming
at ten to-night. There's no moon, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
says he can make the run to Petria in six or seven
hours, barring tire trouble."</p>

<p>"Does he take us, too?" demanded Lieson.
"I'm tired of hanging around here. What kind
of a truck has he got?"</p>

<p>Wapley was so long in answering that Betty
nervously wondered if he could have discovered
the register. She risked a peep and found that
both men were absorbed in filling their pipes.
These lighted and drawing well, Wapley consented
to answer his companion's question.</p>

<p>"Got a one-ton truck. Plenty of room under
the seat for us. He's kind of leery of the constables,
'cause he's been doing a nice little night
trade between Laurel Grove and Petria carrying
one thing and another, but he's willing to do the
job on shares."</p>

<p>Lieson yawned noisily.</p>

<p>"Wish we had some grub," he observed.
"Guess the training we got at Peabody's will come
in handy if we don't eat again till we sell the
chickens. Wouldn't you like to have seen the old
miser's face when he found his chickens were
gone?"</p>

<p>So, thought Betty, she had not been mistaken;
the black rooster was the same one who had been
the pride of Mrs. Peabody's heart.</p>

<p>A burst of harsh laughter from Wapley
startled her. Leaning forward, she could see him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
stretched out on the floor, his head resting on his
coat, doubled up to form a pillow.</p>

<p>"What do you know!" he gurgled, the tears
standing in his eyes. "Didn't I run into Bob
Henderson, of all people!"</p>

<p>Lieson was incredulous.</p>

<p>"You're fooling," he said sullenly. "What
would Bob be doing in Laurel Grove? Unless he
was playing ferret! I'd wring his neck with
pleasure if I thought the old man sent him over
to spy."</p>

<p>"Don't worry," counseled Wapley, waving his
pipe airily. "The lad doesn't hook us up with
the missing biddies. They never knew they were
stolen till ten o'clock this morning. The old man
sold 'em to Ryerson, and the hen houses stayed
shut up till he came to get 'em. Can you beat
that for luck?"</p>

<p>Both men went off into roars of laughter.</p>

<p>"We needn't have spent the night lifting 'em,"
said Lieson when he could speak. "I hate to lose
my night's rest. What did Bob say about it?
Was the old man mad?"</p>

<p>"'Bout crazy," admitted Wapley gravely.
"Bob wasn't home, but the old lady told him he
carried on somethin' great. Wish we could 'a'
heard him rave. But, Lieson, you haven't got it
all. Betty Gordon's run off, and Peabody's doped
it out she ran off with the hens!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl in the room above clapped her hand
to her mouth. She had almost cried out. So
Mr. Peabody could accuse her of being a thief!
But what were the men saying?</p>

<p>"What would the girl do with hens?" propounded
Lieson. "Bob think she stole 'em?"</p>

<p>"Bob's so close-mouthed," growled Wapley.
"But I guess he knows where she went all right.
He says she had nothing to do with the hens disappearing,
and I told him I thought he was right!
But Peabody figures out she was mad and chased
'em into the woods to spite him. And he's hunting
for her and his hens with fire in his eye."</p>

<p>Lieson knocked the ashes from his pipe and
yawned again.</p>

<p>"Wonder what Peabody's got against her
now?" he speculated. "For a boarder, that kid
had a pretty pindling time. Well, if we're going
to be bumped around in a truck all night, I'll say
we ought to take a nap while we can get it."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Wapley. "But I ain't aiming
to go on any such trip without a bite of supper.
The rain's stopped, and I'm going to snooze
a bit and then go down the road to that farmhouse
and see how they feel about feeding a poor
unfortunate who's starving. I'll milk for 'em for
a square meal."</p>

<p>Betty, shivering with excitement, crouched on
the floor afraid to risk moving until they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
be asleep. Her one thought was to get away
from the house and find Bob. Bob would know
what to do. Bob would get the chickens back to
the Peabodys and herself over to the haven of
Doctor Guerin's house, somehow. Bob would be
sorry for Wapley and Lieson even if they had
turned chicken thieves. If she could only get to
Bob before he set out for home or if she might
meet him on the road, everything would be all
right, Bob <i>must</i> wait for her.</p>

<p>There were no back stairs to the house, and it
required grit to go softly down the one flight of
stairs and steal past the door of the parlor where
the two men lay, but Betty set her teeth and did
it. Once on the porch she put on her hat and
sweater, for a cool wind had sprung up; and then
how she ran!</p>

<p>The road was muddy, and her skirt was
splashed before she slowed down to gain her
breath. Anxiously she scanned the road ahead,
wondering if there was another way Bob could
take to reach Bramble Farm. As usual when one
is worried, a brand-new torment assailed her.
Suppose he should take the road to Glenside, that
he might stop in to see her! He, of course, pictured
her safe at the doctor's.</p>

<p>"Want a lift?" drawled a lazy, pleasant voice.</p>

<p>A gawky, blue-eyed boy about Bob Henderson's
age beamed at her from a dilapidated old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
buggy. The fat, white horse also seemed to regard
her benevolently.</p>

<p>"It's sort of muddy," said the boy diffidently.
"If you don't mind the stuffing on the seat&mdash;it's
worn through&mdash;I can give you a ride to Laurel
Grove."</p>

<p>Betty accepted thankfully, but she was not very
good company, it must be confessed, her thoughts
being divided between schemes to hasten the
desultory pace of the fat white horse and wonder
as to how she was to find Bob in the town.</p>

<p>The fat white horse stopped of his own accord
at a pleasant looking house on the outskirts of the
town, and Betty, in a brown study, was suddenly
conscious that the boy was waiting for her.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said in some confusion. "Is this
your house? Well, you were ever so kind to give
me a lift, and I truly thank you!"</p>

<p>She smiled at him and climbed out, and the lad,
who had been secretly admiring her and wondering
what she could be thinking about so absorbedly,
wished for the tenth time that he had a sister.</p>

<p>Laurel Grove was a bustling country town, a
bit livelier than Glenside, and Betty, when she
had traversed the main street twice, began to be
aware that curious glances were being cast at her.</p>

<p>"I'd go shopping, I'd do anything, for an excuse
to go into every store," she thought distractedly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
"if only I had a dollar bill! Where can
Bob be? I can't have missed him!"</p>

<p>There was every reason to think she had missed
him, except her determined optimism, but after
she had been to the drug store and the hardware
store and the post-office, all more or less public
meeting places, and found no sign of Bob, Betty
began to feel a trifle discouraged. Then two men
on the curb gave her a clue.</p>

<p>"I've been hanging around all day," declared
one, evidently a thrifty farmer. "Came over to
get some grinding done, and the blame mill machinery
broke. They just started grinding an
hour ago."</p>

<p>So there was a mill, and Bob often had to go
to mills for Mr. Peabody. Betty did not know
why he should have to come so far, but it was
quite possible that some whim of the master of
Bramble Farm had sent him to the Laurel Grove
mill. Betty stepped up to the farmer and addressed
him quietly.</p>

<p>"Please, will you tell me where the mill is?"
she asked.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<small>SPREADING THE NET</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">He</span> was a nice, fatherly kind of person, and he
insisted on walking with Betty to the corner and
pointing out the low roof of the mill down a side
street.</p>

<p>"No water power, just electricity," he explained.
"Give me a water mill, every time; this
current stuff is mighty unreliable."</p>

<p>Betty thanked him, and hurried down the
street. She was sure she saw the sorrel tied outside
the mill, and when she reached the hitching
posts, sure enough, there was the familiar old
wagon, with some filled bags in it, and the drooping,
tired old sorrel horse that had come to meet
her when she stepped from the train at Hagar's
Corners.</p>

<p>"Betty! For the love of Mike!" Bob's language
was expressive, if not elegant.</p>

<p>Betty whirled. She had not seen the boy come
down the steps of the mill office, and she was
totally unprepared to hear his voice.</p>

<p>"Why, Bob!" The unmistakable relief and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
gladness that shone in her tired face brought a
little catch to Bob's throat.</p>

<p>To hide it, he spoke gruffly.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here? It's after four
o'clock, and I'll get Hail Columbia when I get
back. Mill's been out of order all day, and I had
to wait. Haven't you been to Doctor Guerin's?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet." Betty pulled at his sleeve nervously.
"Oh, Bob, there's so much I must tell
you! And after ten o'clock it will be too late.
To think he thought I stole his old chickens! And
where is Petria?"</p>

<p>Bob gazed at her in amazement. This incoherent
stream of words meant nothing to him.</p>

<p>"Petria?" he repeated, catching at a straw.
"Why, Petria's a big city, sort of a center for
farm products. All the commission houses have
home offices there. Why?"</p>

<p>"That's where Mr. Peabody's chickens are going,"
Betty informed him, "unless you can think
of a way to stop 'em."</p>

<p>"Mr. Peabody's chickens? Have you got
'em?" asked Bob in wonder.</p>

<p>Betty stamped her foot.</p>

<p>"Bob Henderson, how can you be so stupid!"
she stormed. "What would I be doing with
stolen chickens&mdash;unless you think I stole them?"</p>

<p>"Now don't go off into a temper," said Bob
placidly. "I see where I have to drive you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Glenside, anyway. Might as well go the whole
show and be half a day late while I'm about it.
Hop in, Betty, and you can tell me this wonderful
tale while we're traveling."</p>

<p>Betty was tired out from excitement, fear, insufficient
food and the long distance she had
walked. Her nerves protested loudly, and to
Bob's astonishment and dismay she burst into
violent weeping.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say!" he felt vainly in his pocket for a
handkerchief. "Betty, don't cry like that! What
did I say wrong? Don't you want to go to Glenside?
What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"I want you to listen," sobbed Betty. "I'm
trying to tell you as fast as I can that Wapley
and Lieson stole Mr. Peabody's chickens.
They've got 'em all crated, and an automobile
truck is coming at ten o'clock to-night to take
them to Petria. So there!"</p>

<p>Bob asked a few direct questions that soon put
him in possession of all the facts. When he had
heard the full story he took out the hitching rope
he had put under the seat and tied the sorrel to
the railing again.</p>

<p>"Come on," he said briefly.</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;where are we going?" quavered
Betty, a little in awe of this stern new Bob with
the resolute chin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"To the police recorder's," was the uncompromising
reply.</p>

<p>The recorder was young and possessed of
plenty of what Bob termed "pep," and when he
heard what Bob had to tell him, for Betty was
stricken with sudden dumbness, he immediately
mapped out a plan that should catch all the
wrong-doers in one net.</p>

<p>"The fellow we want to get hold of is this
truck driver," he explained. "You didn't hear
his name?"</p>

<p>Betty shook her head.</p>

<p>"Well, to get him, our men will have to wait
till he comes for the crates," said the recorder.
"I'll send a couple of 'em out to this farm&mdash;they
know the old D. Smith place well enough&mdash;and
they can hang around till the truck comes and
then take 'em all in. I'm sorry, but I'll have to
hold the girl here as a witness. My wife will
look after her, and she'll be all right."</p>

<p>"I'll stay, too, Betty," Bob promised her
hastily, noting the plea in her eyes.</p>

<p>"All right, so much the better," said the recorder
heartily. "We'll put you both up for the
night. It won't be necessary for you to see the
prisoners to-night, and to-morrow you'll both be
mighty good witnesses for this Mr. Peabody. I'll
send for him in the morning."</p>

<p>Bob's sense of humor was tickled at the thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
of stabling the sorrel in a livery stable and charging
the bill to his employer. A vision of what
would be said to him caused his eyes to dance as
he gave orders to the stableman to see that the
horse had an extra good measure of oats.</p>

<p>But when he came back to the recorder's for
supper he found Betty sitting close beside the recorder's
wife, crying as though her heart would
break.</p>

<p>"Why, Betty!" he protested. "You don't
usually act like this. What does ail you&mdash;are you
sick?"</p>

<p>"It isn't fair!" protested Betty passionately.
"Wapley and Lieson worked so hard and Mr.
Peabody was mean to 'em! I don't want to save
his old chickens for him! I'd much rather the
hired men got the money. And I won't be a witness
for him and get them into prison!"</p>

<p>Bob looked shocked at this outburst, but Mrs.
Bender only continued to soothe the girl, and
presently Betty's sobs grew less violent, and by
and by ceased.</p>

<p>After supper Mrs. Bender played for them
and sang a little, and then, declaring that Betty
looked tired to death, took her upstairs to the
blue and white guest-room, where, after she had
helped her to undress and loaned her one of her
own pretty nightgowns, she turned off the lights
and sat beside her till she fell asleep. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
first time in months, Betty was encouraged to talk
about her mother, and she told this new friend of
her great loss, her life with the Arnolds, and
about her Uncle Dick. It both rested and refreshed
her to give this confidence, and her sleep
that night was unbroken and dreamless.</p>

<p>Long after Betty was asleep, Bob and the recorder
played checkers, Mrs. Bender sitting near
with her sewing. Bob was starved for companionship,
and something about the lad, his eager eyes,
perhaps, or his evident need of interested guidance,
appealed to Recorder Bender.</p>

<p>"You say you were born in the poorhouse?" he
asked, between games. "Was your mother born
in this township?"</p>

<p>Bob explained, and the Benders were both interested
in the mention of the box of papers.
Encouraged by friendly auditors, Bob told his
meager story, unfolding in its recital a very fair
picture of conditions as they existed at Bramble
Farm.</p>

<p>Betty lay in dreamless sleep, but Bob, in a
room across the hall, tossed and turned restlessly.
At half-past ten he heard the recorder go out,
and knew he was going to see if the chicken
thieves and motor truck driver had been brought
in by his men. Bob wondered how it seemed to
be arrested, and he fervently resolved never to
court the experience. He was asleep before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
recorder returned, but woke once during the night.
A heavy truck was lumbering through the street,
the driver singing in a high sweet tenor voice,
probably to keep himself awake, Bob's swift
thoughts flew to Wapley and Lieson, and he wondered
if they were asleep. How could they sleep
in jail?</p>

<p>Breakfast in the Bender household was just as
pleasant and cheerful and unhurried as supper
had been. Mrs. Bender in a white and green
morning frock beamed upon Bob and Betty and
urged delicious viands upon them till they begged
for mercy. It was, she said, so nice to have "four
at the table."</p>

<p>Mr. Bender pushed back his chair at last,
glancing at his watch.</p>

<p>"The hearing is set for ten o'clock," he announced
quietly. "Mr. Peabody has been notified
and should be here any minute. I think we had
better walk down to the office. Catherine, if
you're ready&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bender smiled at Betty. She had promised
to see her through.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<small>IN AMIABLE CONFERENCE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Betty's</span> sole idea of a court had been gained
from a scene or two in the once-a-week Pineville
motion picture theater, and Bob had even less
knowledge. They both thought there might be a
crowd, a judge in a black gown, and some noise
and excitement.</p>

<p>Instead Recorder Bender unlocked the door of
a little one-story building and ushered them into
a small room furnished simply with a long table,
a few chairs, and a case of law books.</p>

<p>Presently two men came in, nodded to Mrs.
Bender, and conferred in whispers with Mr. Bender.
There was a scuffling step outside the door
and Mr. Peabody entered.</p>

<p>"Huh, there you are!" he greeted Bob. "For
all of you, I might have been hunting my horse
and wagon all night. Mighty afraid to let any
one know where you are."</p>

<p>"Mr. Peabody?" asked the recorder crisply,
and suddenly all his quiet friendliness was gone
and an able official with a clear, direct gaze and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
a rather stern chin faced the farmer. "Sit down,
please, until we're all ready."</p>

<p>Mr. Peabody subsided into a chair, and the two
men went away. They were back in a few moments,
and with them they brought Wapley and
Lieson and a lad, little more than a boy, who was
evidently the truck driver.</p>

<p>"Close the door," directed the recorder.
"Now, Mr. Peabody, if you'll just sit here&mdash;"
he indicated a chair at one side of the table. With
a clever shifting of the group he soon had them
arranged so that Wapley, Lieson, the truck
driver, and the two men who had brought them
in were sitting on one side of the table, and Betty,
Bob, Mrs. Bender and Mr. Peabody on the other.
He himself took a seat between Betty and Mr.
Peabody.</p>

<p>"Now you all understand," he said pleasantly,
"that this is merely an informal hearing. We
want to learn what both sides have to say."</p>

<p>Mr. Peabody gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>"I don't see what the other side can have to
say!" he exclaimed contemptuously. "They've
been caught red-handed, stealing my chickens."</p>

<p>The recorder ignored this, and turned to
Lieson.</p>

<p>"You've worked for farmers about here in
other seasons," he said. "And, from all I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
hear, your record was all right. What made you
put yourself in line for a workhouse term?"</p>

<p>Lieson cleared his throat, glancing at Wapley.</p>

<p>"It can't be proved we was stealing," he argued
sullenly. "Them chickens was going to be sold on
commission."</p>

<p>"Taking 'em off at ten o'clock at night to save
'em from sunburn, wasn't you?" demanded Mr.
Peabody sarcastically. "You never was a quick
thinker, Lieson."</p>

<p>"Now, Lieson," struck in Mr. Bender patiently,
"that's no sort of use. Miss Gordon here
overheard your plans. We know those chickens
came from the Peabody farm, and that you and
Wapley had a bargain with Tubbs to sell them
in Petria. What I want to hear is your excuse.
It's been my experience that every one who takes
what doesn't belong to him has an excuse, good
or bad. What's yours?"</p>

<p>At the mention of Betty's name, Lieson and
Wapley had shot her a quick look. She made a
little gesture of helplessness, infinitely appealing.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry," the expressive brown eyes told
them, "I just have to tell what I heard, if I'm
asked, but I wouldn't willingly do you harm."</p>

<p>Lieson threw back his head and struck the table
a sounding blow.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why we took those blamed
chickens!" he cried. "You can believe it or not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
but we were going to sell 'em in Petria, and all
over and above twenty-five dollars they brought,
Peabody would have got back. He owes us that
amount. Ask him."</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" shouted Peabody, rising, his face
crimson. "A lie, I tell you! A lie cooked up by
a sneaking, crooked, chicken-thief to save himself!"</p>

<p>Lieson and Wapley were on their feet, and
Betty saw the glint of something shiny in Peabody's
hand.</p>

<p>"Sit down, and keep quiet!" said the recorder
levelly. "That will be about all the shouting,
please, this morning. And, Mr. Peabody, I'll
trouble you for that automatic!"</p>

<p>The men dropped into their chairs, and Peabody
pushed his pistol across the table. The recorder
opened a drawer and dropped the evil
little thing into it.</p>

<p>"Can you prove that wages are owed you by
Mr. Peabody?" he asked, as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Wapley, who had been silent all along, pulled a
dirty scrap of paper from his pocket.</p>

<p>"There's when we came to Bramble Farm and
when we left, and the money we've had," he said
harshly. "And when we left, it was 'cause he
wouldn't give us what was coming to us&mdash;not just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
a dollar or two of it to spend in Glenside, Miss
Betty can tell you that."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Betty eagerly. "That was what
they quarreled about."</p>

<p>The recorder, who had been studying the bit
of paper, asked a question without raising his
eyes.</p>

<p>"What's this thirty-four cents subtracted from
this two dollars for&mdash;June twenty-fourth, it seems
to be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that was when we had the machinist who
came to fix the binder stay to supper," explained
Wapley simply. "Lieson and me paid Peabody
for butter on the table that night, 'cause Edgeworth's
mighty particular about what he gets to
eat. He'd come ten miles to fix the machine, and
we wanted him to have a good meal."</p>

<p>Mr. Peabody turned a vivid scarlet. He did
not relish these disclosures of his domestic
economy.</p>

<p>"What in tarnation has that got to do with
stealing my chickens?" he demanded testily,
"Ain't you going to commit these varmints?"</p>

<p>The truck driver, who had been studying Mr.
Peabody with disconcerting steadiness, suddenly
announced the result of his scrutiny, apparently
not in the last in awe of the jail sentence shadow
under which he stood.</p>

<p>"Well, you poor, little, mean-livered, low-down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
pesky, slithering snake-in-the-grass," he
said slowly and distinctly, addressing himself to
Mr. Peabody with unflattering directness, "now I
know where I've seen your homely mug before.
You're the skunk that scattered ground glass on
that stretch of road between the crossroads and
Miller's Pond, and then laughed when I ruined
four of my good tires. I knew I'd seen you somewhere,
but I couldn't place you.</p>

<p>"Why, do you know, Mr. Bender," he turned
excitedly to the recorder, "that low-down coward
wouldn't put ground glass on his own road&mdash;might
get him into trouble with the authorities.
No, he goes and scatters the stuff on some other
farmer's highway, and when I lodge a complaint
against the man whose name was on the mail box
and face him in Glenside, he isn't the man I saw
laughing at all! I made a complete fool of myself.
I suppose this guy had a grudge against
some neighbor and took that way of paying it
out; and getting some motorist in Dutch, too.
These rubes hates automobiles, anyway."</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" retorted Mr. Peabody, but his tone
did not carry conviction. "I never scattered any
ground glass."</p>

<p>The recorder fluttered a batch of papers impressively.</p>

<p>"Well, I've two complaints that may be filed
against you," he announced decisively. "One for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
uncollected wages due James Wapley and Enos
Lieson, and one charging that you willfully made
a public highway dangerous for automobile traffic.
Also, I believe, this boy, Bob Henderson, has
not been sent to school regularly."</p>

<p>This was a surprise to Bob, who had long ago
accepted the fact that school for him was over.
But Mr. Peabody was plainly worried.</p>

<p>"What you want me to do?" he whined. "I'm
willing to be fair. No man can say I'm not just."</p>

<p>The recorder leaned back in his chair, and his
good wife, watching, knew that he had gained his
point.</p>

<p>"Litigation and law-squabble," he said tranquilly,
"waste money, time, and too often defeat
the ends. Why, in this instance, don't we effect
a compromise? You, Mr. Peabody, pay these
men the money you owe them and drop the charge
of stealing; you will have your chickens back and
the knowledge that their enmity toward you is
removed. Tubbs, I'm sure, will agree to forget
the broken glass, and the schooling charge may
lapse, provided something along that line is done
for Bob this winter."</p>

<p>Mr. Peabody was shrewd enough to see that
he could not hope for better terms. As long as
he had the chickens to sell to Ryerson, he had no
grounds for complaint. He hated "like sin" as
Bob said, to pay the money to Wapley and Lieson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
but under the recorder's unwavering eye, he
counted out twenty-five dollars&mdash;twelve dollars
and fifty cents apiece&mdash;which the men pocketed
smilingly. A word or two of friendly admonition
from Mr. Bender, and the men were dismissed.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," sighed Betty as they left the
room, "that I didn't have to say anything against
them."</p>

<p>"Well, are you coming along with me?" asked
Peabody, almost graciously for him. "There's a
letter there for you, Betty. From your uncle, I
calculate, since the postmark is Washington.
And my word, Bob, you don't seem in any great
hurry to get back to your chores; the sorrel must
be eating his head off in Haverford's stable."</p>

<p>The recorder exchanged a look with his wife.</p>

<p>"Mr. Peabody," he said, "I shall be detained
here an hour or so, and I don't want these young
folks to leave until I have a word with them.
Mrs. Bender will be only too glad to have you
stay for lunch with us, and I'll meet you up at the
house. My wife, Mr. Peabody."</p>

<p>"Pleased to meet you, Ma'am," stammered
Mr. Peabody awkwardly. "I ought to be getting
on toward home. But I suppose, if the chickens
were fed this morning, they can wait."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you're hungry yourself," answered
Mrs. Bender, slipping an arm about Betty. "Suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
we walk up to the house now, Mr. Peabody,
and I'll have lunch ready by the time Mr. Bender
is free."</p>

<p>Betty looked back as they were leaving the
room and saw the truck driver slouched disconsolately
in a chair opposite the recorder.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is he arrested?" she whispered half-fearfully
to Mrs. Bender. Mr. Peabody and Bob
were walking on ahead.</p>

<p>"No, dear," was the answer. "But Mr. Bender
will doubtless give him a good raking over
the coals, which is just what he needs. Fred
Tubbs is a Laurel Grove boy, and his mother is
one of the sweetest women in town. He's always
been a little wild, and lately he's been in with all
kinds of riff-raff. Harry heard rumors that he
was trucking in shady transactions, but he never
could get hold of proof. Now he has him just
where he wants him. He'll tell Fred a few truths
and maybe knock some sense into him before he
does something that will send him to state's
prison."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<small>A NEW ACQUAINTANCE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bender</span> insisted that Mr. Peabody
should sit down on her shady front porch while
she set the table and got luncheon. Betty followed
her like a shadow, and while they were laying
the silver together the woman smiled at the
downcast face.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?" she asked gently. "You
don't want to go back to Bramble Farm; is that
it?"</p>

<p>Betty nodded miserably.</p>

<p>"Why do I have to?" she argued. "Can't I
go and stay with the Guerins? They'd like to
have me, I'm sure they would."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see what Mr. Bender has to say,"
answered Mrs. Bender diplomatically. "Here he
comes now. You call Bob and Mr. Peabody, and
mind, not a word while we're at the table. Mr.
Bender hates to have an argument while he's eating."</p>

<p>The luncheon was delicious, and Mr. Peabody
thoroughly enjoyed it, if the service was rather
confusing. He thought the Benders were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
foolish to live as they did instead of saving up
money for their old age, but since they did, he was
glad they did not retrench when they had company.
That, by the way, was Mr. Peabody's original
conception of hospitality&mdash;to save on his
guests by serving smaller portions of food.</p>

<p>"We'll go into the living-room and have a little
talk now," proposed the recorder, leading
the way into the pleasant front room where a big
divan fairly invited three to sit upon it.</p>

<p>"Betty and Bob on either side of me," said Mr.
Bender cordially, pointing to the sofa, "and, Mr.
Peabody, just roll up that big chair."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bender sat down in a rocking chair, and
the recorder seated himself between the two young
folks.</p>

<p>"Betty doesn't want to come back with me,"
said Mr. Peabody resentfully. "I can tell by the
way she acts. But her uncle sent her up to us,
and there she should stay, I say, till he sends for
her again. It doesn't look right for a girl to be
gallivanting all over the township."</p>

<p>"I could stay with the Guerins," declared Betty
stubbornly. "Mrs. Guerin is lovely to me."</p>

<p>"I should think you'd have a little pride about
asking 'em to take you in, when they've got two
daughters of their own and he as hard up as most
country doctors are," said the astute Mr. Peabody.
"Your uncle pays me for your board and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
certainly don't intend to turn over any checks to
Doc Guerin."</p>

<p>Betty flushed. She had not thought at all about
the monetary side of the question. She knew that
Doctor Guerin's practice was largely among the
farmers, who paid him in produce as often as in
cash, and, as Mr. Peabody said, he could not be
expected to take a guest for an indefinite time.</p>

<p>"You know you could stay with me, Betty,"
Mrs. Bender broke in quickly, "but we're going
away for a month next week, and there isn't time
to change the plans. Mr. Bender has his vacation."</p>

<p>"Gee, Betty," came from Bob, "if you're not
coming back, what'll I do?"</p>

<p>"Work," said Mr. Peabody grimly.</p>

<p>Betty's quick temper flared up suddenly.</p>

<p>"I won't go back!" she declared passionately.
"I'll do housework, I'll scrub or wash dishes, anything!
I hate Bramble Farm!"</p>

<p>"Now, now, sister," said the recorder in his
even, pleasant voice. "Keep cool, and we'll find a
way. There's this letter Mr. Peabody speaks
about. Perhaps that will bring you good news."</p>

<p>"I suppose it's from Uncle Dick," admitted
Betty, wiping her eyes. "Maybe he will want me
to come where he is."</p>

<p>"Well now, Betty," Mr. Peabody spoke persuasively,
"you come along home with me and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
maybe things will be more to your liking. Perhaps
I haven't always done just as you'd like. But
then, you recollect, I ain't used to girls and their
notions. Your uncle won't think you're fit to be
trusted to travel alone if I write him and tell him
you run away from the farm."</p>

<p>Betty looked dumbly at Mr. Bender.</p>

<p>"I think you had better go with Mr. Peabody,"
he said kindly, answering her unspoken question.
"You see, Betty, it isn't very easy to explain, but
when you want to leave a place, any place, always
go openly and as far as possible avoid the significance
of running away. You do not have to
stay for one moment where any one is actively unkind
to you, but since your uncle placed you in the
care of Mr. and Mrs. Peabody, if you can, it is
wiser to wait till you hear from him before making
any change."</p>

<p>"Make him be nicer to Bob," urged Betty obstinately.</p>

<p>"I aim to send him to school this winter," said
Mr. Peabody, rushing to his own defense. "And
I can get a man now to help out with the chores.
He's lame, but a good milker. Can get him right
away, too&mdash;this afternoon. Came by asking for
work and I guess he'll stay all winter. Bob can
take it easy for a day or two."</p>

<p>"Then he can drive over with Betty Saturday
afternoon and spend Sunday with us." Mrs. Bender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
was quick to seize this advantage. "That will
be fine. We'll see you, Betty, before we go away.
And, dear, you must write to me often."</p>

<p>So it was settled that Betty was to return to
Bramble Farm. The Benders were warmly interested
in both young folks, and they were not the
sort of people to lose sight of any one for whom
they cared. Mr. Peabody knew that Bob and
Betty had gained friends who would be actively
concerned for their welfare, and he was entirely
sincere in promising to make it easier for them in
the future.</p>

<p>He and Bob and Betty and the crated chickens
drove into the lane leading to Bramble Farm about
half-past four.</p>

<p>Betty's first thought was for her letter. The
moment she saw the hand-writing, she knew it was
from her uncle.</p>

<p>"Bob, Bob! Where are you?" she called, running
out to the barn, waving the letter wildly after
the first reading. "Oh, Bob, why aren't you ever
where I want you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Peabody and his wife were still busy over
the chickens.</p>

<p>Bob, it seemed, was engaged in the unlovely task
of cleaning the cow stables, after having, on Mr.
Peabody's orders, gone after the lame man to engage
him for the fall and winter work. But Betty
was so eager to share her news with him that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
stood just outside the stable and read him bits of
the letter through the open window.</p>

<p>"Uncle Dick's in Washington!" she announced
blithely. "He's been there a week, and he hopes
he can send for me before the month is up. Won't
that be fine, Bob? I'm not going to unpack my
trunk, because I want to be able to go the minute
he sends me word. And, oh, yes, he sends me another
check. Now we can have some more goodies
from the grocery store, next time you go to Glenside."</p>

<p>"You cash that check and put the money away
where you and no one else can find it," advised
Bob seriously. "Don't let yourself get out of
funds again, Betty. It may be another long wait
before you hear from your uncle."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, that won't happen again," said Betty
carelessly. "He's in Washington, so everything
must be all right. But, Bob, isn't it funny? he
hasn't had one of my letters! He says he supposes
there's a pile of mail for him at the lawyer's
office, but he hasn't had time to run up there,
and, anyway, the lawyer is ill and his office is in
great confusion. Uncle Dick writes he is glad to
think of me enjoying the delights of Bramble
Farm instead of the city's heat&mdash;Washington is
hot in summer, I know daddy used to say so.
And he sends the kindest messages to Mr. and
Mrs. Peabody&mdash;I wish he knew that old miser!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
I've written him all about you, but of course he
hasn't read the letters."</p>

<p>All through supper and the brief evening that
followed Betty was light-hearted and gay. She
re-read her Uncle Dick's letter twenty times, and
because of the relief it promised her found it easy
to be gracious to Mr. Peabody. That man was
put out because his new hired hand refused to
sleep in the attic, declaring that the barn was
cooler, as in fact it was.</p>

<p>"If I catch you smoking in there, I'll wring
your neck," was the farmer's amiable good-night
to the lame man as he limped out toward his selected
sleeping place.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />
<small>THEIR MUTUAL SECRETS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> woke to find her room almost as light
as day. She had been dreaming of breakfasting
with her uncle in a blue and gold dining-room of
her own furnishing, and for the moment she
thought it was morning. But the light flickered
too much for sunlight, and as she became more
fully awake, she realized it was a red glare.
Fire!</p>

<p>"Fire!" Bob's voice vocalized her cry for
her, and he came tumbling down the uncarpeted
attic stairs with a wild clatter of shoes.</p>

<p>She called to him to wait; but he did not hear,
and raced on out to the barn. The inarticulate
bellow of Mr. Peabody sounded next as, yelling
loudly, he rushed down the stairs and out through
the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Betty!" Mrs. Peabody ran in as Betty struggled
hastily to dress. "Betty! the barn's on fire!
No one knows how long it's been burning. If we
only had a dog, he might have barked! Or a
telephone!"</p>

<p>Betty stifled a hysterical desire to laugh as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
followed the moaning Mrs. Peabody downstairs.
It was not the main barn, she saw with a little
throb of relief as they ran through the yard. Instead
it was the corncrib and wagon house which
stood a little apart from the rest of the buildings.
The cribs were practically empty of corn, for of
course the new crop had not yet matured, and the
only loss would be the two shabby old wagons and
a quantity of more or less worn machinery stored
in the loft overhead. A huge rat, driven from his
home under the corncrib, ran past Betty in the
dark.</p>

<p>"It's all insured," said Mr. Peabody complacently,
watching Bob dash buckets of water on the
tool shed, which was beginning to blister from
the heat. "Well, Keppler, see the blaze from
your place? Nice little bonfire, ain't it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Keppler and his two half-grown sons had
run all the way and were too out of breath to reply
immediately. They were not on especially
good terms with Mr. Peabody, but as his nearest
neighbor they could not let his buildings burn
down without making an effort to help him. They
had left the mother of the family at the telephone
with instructions to call the surrounding neighbors
if Mr. Keppler signaled her to do so with the pistol
he carried.</p>

<p>"Guess you won't need any more help," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Mr. Keppler, regaining his breath. "How'd she
start?"</p>

<p>"Why, when I thought it was the barn, I said to
myself that lazy good-for-nothing lame Phil's been
smoking," replied Mr. Peabody. "But I don't
know how he could set the corncribs afire."</p>

<p>"Where is he now?" cried Betty, remembering
the man's affliction. "He couldn't run&mdash;perhaps
he tried to sleep in the wagon and is burned."</p>

<p>"No, he isn't," said Phil behind her.</p>

<p>He had been watching the fire from the safe
vantage point of a boulder in the apple orchard,
he admitted when cross-questioned. Yes, the
flames had awakened him in the barn where he
slept. No, he couldn't guess how they had started
unless it could have been spontaneous combustion
from the oiled rags he had noticed packed tightly
in a corner of the wagon shed that afternoon.</p>

<p>"Spontaneous combustion!" ejaculated Mr.
Peabody angrily. "If you know that much, why
couldn't you drop me a word, or take away the
rags?"</p>

<p>The lame man looked at him with irritating intentness.</p>

<p>"I thought you might wring my neck if I did,"
he said.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether Phil's a fool or not,"
confided Bob to Betty the next morning; "but
he has old Peabody guessing, that's sure. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
quoting Shakespeare to him at the pump this morning."</p>

<p>Betty lost little time in speculation concerning
Phil, for another worry claimed her attention.</p>

<p>"How can we go to see the Benders Saturday?"
she asked Bob. "Both wagons are burned up."</p>

<p>"Well, we still have the horse," Bob reminded
her cheerfully. "A wagon without a horse isn't
much good, but a horse without a wagon is far
from hopeless. You leave it to me."</p>

<p>Betty was willing. She was dreaming day
dreams about Washington and Uncle Dick,
dreams in which she generously included Bob and
the Benders and Norma Guerin. It was fortunate
for her that she could not see ahead, or
know how slowly the weeks were to drag by
without another letter. How Betty waited and
waited and finally went to the Capitol City to find
her uncle herself will be told in the next volume
of this series, to be called, "Betty Gordon in
Washington; or, Strange Adventures in a Great
City." High-spirited, headstrong, pretty Betty
finds adventures aplenty, not unmixed with a spice
of danger, in the beautiful city of Washington,
and quite unexpectedly she again meets Bob Henderson,
who has left Bramble Farm to seek his
fortune.</p>

<p>That Bob was planning a surprise in connection
with their visit to the Benders, she was well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
aware, but she would not spoil his enjoyment by
trying to force him to divulge his secret. Betty
had a secret of her own, saved up for the eventful
day, which she had no idea of disclosing till
the proper time should arrive.</p>

<p>Saturday morning dawned warm and fair, and
Bob tore into his morning's work, determined to
leave Mr. Peabody no loophole for criticism and,
possibly, detention, though he had promised Bob
the afternoon off. Phil was with them no more,
having ambled off one night without warning and
taken his peculiarities to a possibly more appreciative
circle.</p>

<p>Bob was hungry at noon, but he hardly touched
his dinner, so eager was he to get away from the
table and wash and dress ready for the trip to
Laurel Grove. Poor Bob had no best clothes, but
he resolutely refused to wear overalls to the
Benders, and he had coaxed Mrs. Peabody to get
his heavy winter trousers out of the mothballs and
newspapers in which she had packed them away.
She had washed and ironed a faded shirt for him,
and at least he would be whole and clean.</p>

<p>"Bob," drawled Mr. Peabody, as that youth declined
dessert and prepared to rise from the table,
"before you go, I want to see the wood box filled,
some fresh litter in the pig pens and some fodder
in all the cow mangers. If I'm to do the milking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
I don't want to have to pitch all the fodder,
too."</p>

<p>Bob scowled angrily.</p>

<p>"I haven't time," he muttered. "That'll take
me till two or half-past. You said I could have
the afternoon."</p>

<p>"And I also told you to fill the wood box yesterday,"
retorted Mr. Peabody. "You'll do as I
say, or stay home altogether. Take your choice."</p>

<p>"He's the meanest man who ever lived!"
scolded Betty, following Bob out to the woodshed.
"I'll fill up that old box, Bob, and you go
do the other chores. I'd like to throw this stick
at his head."</p>

<p>Bob laughed, for he had a naturally sweet temper
and seldom brooded over his wrongs.</p>

<p>"He did tell me to fill the box yesterday and I
forgot," he confessed. "Take your time, Betty,
and don't get all hot. And don't scratch your
hands&mdash;they looked as pretty as Mrs. Bender's;
I noticed 'em at the table."</p>

<p>Betty stared after him as he went whistling to
the barn, her apron sagging with the wood she
had piled into it. She glanced scrutinizingly at
her strong, shapely tanned little hands. Did Bob
think they were pretty? Betty herself admired
very white hands with slim pointed fingers like
Norma Guerin's.</p>

<p>She worked to such good purpose that she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the wood box filled and was brushing her hair
when she heard Bob go thumping past her door
on his way to his room. She was dressed and
downstairs when he came down, and he caught
hold of her impulsively and whirled her around
the porch.</p>

<p>"Betty, you're a wonder!" he cried in admiration.
"How did you ever guess the size? And
when did you buy it? You could have knocked me
down with a feather when I saw it spread out
there on the bed."</p>

<p>"I'm glad it fits you so well," answered Betty
demurely, surveying the neat blue and white shirt
she had bought for him. "I took one of your old
ones over to Glenside. Oh, it didn't cost much!"
she hastened to assure him, interpreting the look
he gave her. "I'm saving the money Uncle Dick
sent, honestly I am."</p>

<p>Bob insisted that she sit down on the porch
and let him drive round for her, and now it was
Betty's turn to be surprised. The sorrel was harnessed
to a smart rubber-tired runabout.</p>

<p>"Bob Henderson! where did you get it? Whose
is it? Does Mr. Peabody know? Let's go
through Glenside and show 'em we look right
sometimes," suggested the astonished Betty.</p>

<p>Bob, beaming with pride, helped her in and
Mrs. Peabody waved them a friendly good-bye.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
She betrayed no surprise at the sight of the runabout
and was evidently in the secret.</p>

<p>"She knows about it," explained Bob, as they
drove off. "I borrowed it from the Kepplers.
Tried to get a horse, too, but they're going driving
Sunday and need the team. This is their single
harness. Nifty buckles, aren't they?"</p>

<p>Betty praised the runabout to his heart's content,
and they actually did drive through Glenside,
though it was a longer way around, and had the
satisfaction of meeting the Guerins.</p>

<p>Recorder Bender and his wife were delighted to
see them again, and they had a happy time all
planned for them. Saturday night there was a
moving picture show in Laurel Grove, and the
Benders took their guests. Betty had not been
to motion pictures since leaving Pineville and it
was Bob's second experience with the films.</p>

<p>Sunday morning they all went to church, and
the long, delightful summer Sunday afternoon
they spent on the cool, shady porch, exchanging
confidences and making plans for the future.</p>

<p>"I'm saving the money I get for the carvings,"
said Bob, "and when I get enough I'll dig up the
little black tin box and off I'll go. I've got to get
some education and amount to something, and
if I stay with the Peabody's till I'm eighteen, my
chance will be gone."</p>

<p>"Promise us one thing, Bob," urged Mrs. Bender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
earnestly. "That you won't go without consulting
us, or at least leaving some word for us.
And that, wherever you go, you'll write."</p>

<p>"I promise," said Bob gratefully. "I haven't
so many friends that I can afford to lose one. You
and Mr. Bender have been awfully good to me."</p>

<p>"We like you!" returned the recorder, with one
of his rare whimsical flashes. "I want to exact the
same promise from Betty&mdash;to write to us wherever
she may go."</p>

<p>"Of course I will!" promised Betty. "I don't
seem to have much luck running away; but when
I do go, I'll surely write and let you know where
I am. And I'll probably be writing to you very
soon from Washington!"</p>
